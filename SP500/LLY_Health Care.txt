Eli Lilly and Company (referred to as the company, Lilly, we, or us) was incorporated in 1901 in Indiana to succeed to the drug manufacturing business founded in Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1876 by Colonel Eli Lilly. We discover, develop, manufacture, and market products in a single business segment—human pharmaceutical products. In March 2019, we completed the disposition of our ownership in Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco), an animal health business.
Our purpose is to unite caring with discovery to create medicines that make life better for people around the world. Most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines.
We manufacture and distribute our products through facilities in the United States (U.S.), including Puerto Rico, and 8 other countries. Our products are sold in approximately 120 countries.

Marketing and Distribution
We sell most of our products worldwide. We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and comply with local regulations.
U.S.
We promote our major products in the U.S. through sales representatives who call upon physicians and other health care professionals. We also promote to healthcare providers in medical journals and online health care channels, distribute literature and samples of certain products to physicians, and exhibit at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S. and we maintain websites with information about our major products. We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales organizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need.
We maintain special business groups to service wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, government and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for discounts or rebates on our products.
6

In the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other health care professionals, and hospitals. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, three wholesale distributors in the U.S.—McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc.—each accounted for between 15 percent and 20 percent of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated revenue in any of these years.
Outside the U.S.
Outside the U.S., we promote our products to healthcare providers primarily through sales representatives and online health care channels. While the products we market vary from country to country, diabetes products constitute the largest single group of our consolidated revenue. Distribution patterns for our products also vary from country to country. In most countries in which we operate, we maintain our own sales organizations, but in some smaller countries we market our products through independent distributors.
Marketing Collaborations
Certain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. For example, we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global agreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products, including Trajenta, Jentadueto®, Jardiance, Glyxambi®, Synjardy®, Trijardy® XR, and Basaglar.
For additional information, see Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Collaborations and Other Arrangements."
Competition
Our products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.
Important competitive factors include effectiveness, safety, and ease of use; formulary placement, price, and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products, processes, modalities, and uses. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, including by developing new modalities, our products become subject to decreased sales, progressive price reductions, or both.
We believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in collaboration with others) or acquiring innovative, cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers, and continuously improving the productivity of our operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products, and it is possible that our products will be, or will become, uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products developed by our competitors.
Generic Pharmaceuticals
One of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals. In the U.S. and Europe, the regulatory approval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic manufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do in research and development and can price their products significantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product, which can cause us to lose a significant portion of the product’s revenue in a very short period of time.
Further, public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be essentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In many countries outside the U.S., intellectual property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products.
7

Biosimilars
Several of our products and approximately half of the potential new medicines in our clinical-stage pipeline are biologics. In the U.S., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. Competition for Lilly’s biologics may be affected by the approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that, due to its analytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the innovator biologic. Approval by the FDA ultimately depends on many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is “highly similar” to the original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.
Globally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator-developed biologics, including the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S., and a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA and in Europe. The patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market before biosimilars may enter that market. However, in the U.S., the product exclusivity period under the BPCIA could be affected by recent government proposals and litigation. See “- Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights.” In addition, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet entirely clear, and will depend on a number of regulatory and marketplace factors that are still developing. In the U.S., currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be “interchangeable” will be considered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the original biologic product. To prove that a biosimilar product is interchangeable, the applicant must demonstrate that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the original biologic product in any given patient, and if the product is administered more than once in a patient, that safety risks and potential for diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the use of the interchangeable biosimilar biologic product and the original biologic product is no greater than the risk of using the original biologic product without switching.
Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. For example, a competitor company has developed a version of insulin lispro that competes with our product Humalog. On the other hand, in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim, we developed Basaglar, a new insulin glargine product, which has the same amino acid sequence as a product currently marketed by a competitor and has launched as a follow-on biologic in the U.S., and as a biosimilar in Europe and Japan. However, in March 2020, the FDA began regulating all of our insulin products as “biologics” rather than “drugs.” Based on FDA draft guidance, this change may lower the requirements for competitor biosimilar products to enter the market, some of which could be designated as interchangeable and therefore substituted for our insulin products at U.S. pharmacies. As such, in June 2020, Mylan N.V. announced that the FDA approved its New Drug Application (NDA) for Semglee, a new insulin glargine product, which it launched as a follow-on biologic in the U.S. that competes with Basaglar. The laws regulating biosimilars continue to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA and remain subject to substantial uncertainty, including with respect to their impact on our business.
U.S. Private Sector Dynamics
In the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare providers significantly affects the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals. Health plans, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, typically maintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan's formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-of-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion.
8

Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations and formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers, increased co-insurance levels, and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy, safety profile, or patient ease of use, but also by providing rebates. Value-based agreements, where pricing is based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes, are another tool that may be utilized between payers and pharmaceutical companies as formulary placement and pricing are negotiated. Price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. We expect these downward pricing pressures will continue to negatively affect our consolidated results of operations. In addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible plans and higher co-insurance or co-pays. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see “- Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access - U.S.”
Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights
Overview
Intellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new medicines. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products, product uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, as discussed below, for some products we have effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.
The patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound patent), particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., various European countries, and Japan. These patents may be issued based upon the filing of international patent applications, usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applications covering compounds are generally filed during the Discovery Phase of the drug discovery process, which is described in the “Research and Development” section below. In general, national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application, which is often years prior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:
•Patent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during examination by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).
•Patent term restoration is a statutory right provided to U.S. patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the FDA. To make up for a portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the FDA review process, a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration. Patent term restoration is limited by a formula and cannot be calculated until product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There is a five-year cap on any restoration, and no patent's expiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. also offer forms of patent term restoration. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates are available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency (EMA) approval). Similarly, in Japan, South Korea, and Australia, patent terms can be extended up to five years, depending on the length of regulatory review and other factors.
Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product, which often results in severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However, in some cases the innovator company may retain exclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secrets, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective market exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:
9

•Regulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting regulatory applications for marketing approval based on the innovator company’s regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period of data package protection depends on the country. For example, the period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics as described below), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent.
•Under the BPCIA, the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show its molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the FDA will consider on a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, subject to certain conditions. The BPCIA is part of the Affordable Care Act, the constitutionality of which is currently being litigated.
•In the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted, this “pediatric exclusivity” provides an additional six months of exclusivity, which is added to the term of data protection as well as to the term of any relevant patents, to the extent these protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity attaches to the term of any relevant patent, pediatric exclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity—i.e., a bar to generic approval, not a patent right.
•Under the U.S. orphan drug law, a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive "orphan" designation if it is intended to treat a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its development and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits, orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven years of market exclusivity, meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric exclusivity, the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs in parallel with any applicable patents.
Outside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely, and in a number of these markets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPs) administered by the World Trade Organization, more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing countries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of “flexibilities” allowed under the agreement. Thus, some types of patents, such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules, are not available in certain developing countries. Further, many developing countries, and some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in TRIPs.

Worldwide, we sell all of our major products under trademarks consisting of our product names, logos, and unique product appearances (e.g., the appearance of our Trulicity autoinjector) which we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operations. Trademark protection varies throughout the world, with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered. Registrations are normally for fixed but renewable terms. Trademark protection often extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product.

Patent Licenses and Collaborations
Most of our major products are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreements. For information on our license and collaboration agreements, including our agreement with Incyte Corporation related to Olumiant, see Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4, Collaborations and Other Arrangements."
Patent Challenges
In the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, authorizes the FDA to approve generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics, which are discussed below in more detail) when the generic manufacturer has not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only “bioequivalence” between the generic version and the NDA-approved drug—not safety and efficacy. Establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company.
Absent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator’s patents expire. However, after the innovator has marketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more or all of the patents listed in the innovator’s NDA are invalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a “Paragraph IV certification.” If the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic manufacturer, the FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic company’s application for a 30-month period (which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the NDA-listed patents are challenged, the first filer(s) of a Paragraph IV certification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers.
Generic manufacturers use Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition, generic companies have shown willingness to launch “at risk,” i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge. We are currently in Hatch-Waxman litigation involving Alimta with a single generic manufacturer. For more information on Hatch-Waxman litigation involving the company, see Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16, Contingencies.”
Under the BPCIA, the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires, 12 years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However, the BPCIA does provide a mechanism for a competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator’s patents as early as four years after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.
The patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA, and the BPCIA itself, is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA as well as courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. Further, in the U.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators’ intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators’ market exclusivity. See also “- Competition - Biosimilars.”
In addition, there is a procedure in U.S. patent law, known as inter partes review (IPR), which allows any member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before Administrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court. In addition, the challenged patents are not accorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the IPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents.
Outside the U.S., the legal doctrines and processes by which pharmaceutical patents can be challenged vary widely. In recent years, we have experienced an increase in patent challenges from generic manufacturers in many countries outside the U.S.
For more information on administrative challenges and litigation involving our intellectual property rights, see Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16, Contingencies.”

Government Regulation of Our Operations
Our operations are regulated extensively by numerous national, state, and local agencies.
Regulation of Products
The lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing, data analysis, manufacturing development, and regulatory review necessary for governmental approvals of our products is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introductions and revenue generation. In addition, our operations are subject to complex federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations concerning relationships with healthcare providers and suppliers, the environment, occupational health and safety, and data privacy. Compliance with the laws and regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products will continue to require substantial effort, expense, and capital investment.
Of particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations that include the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling, marketing, promotion, advertising, dissemination of information, and post-marketing surveillance of those products.
Following approval, our products remain subject to regulation by various agencies in connection with labeling, import, export, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, and safety reporting. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell. The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market. The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.
The FDA extensively regulates all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under its current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations. Outside the U.S., our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the EMA in Europe and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan. Specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country. Regulatory requirements and approval processes outside the U.S. may differ from those in the U.S. and may involve additional costs and uncertainties.
We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide quality systems and controls in our manufacturing, product development, and process development operations in an effort to ensure sustained compliance with cGMP and similar regulations. However, in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements, we become subject to potential government investigations, interruptions in production, fines and penalties, delays in new product approvals, and reputational harm. Certain of our products are manufactured by third parties, and their failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us through failure to supply product to us or delays in new product approvals. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business.
We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may affect our research, development or production efforts.
13

Emergency Use Authorizations
The Secretary of Health and Human Services may authorize unapproved medical products to be manufactured, marketed, and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government. After an emergency has been announced, the Secretary of Health and Human Services may authorize EUAs for the use of specific products based on criteria established by statute, including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. An EUA is subject to additional conditions and restrictions, such as the obligation to provide facts sheets for healthcare providers administering the product and those to whom it is administered, adverse event monitoring and reporting, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements by product manufacturers. The FDA may also establish additional discretionary conditions of authorization that the FDA deems necessary or appropriate to protect the public health, including conditions related to product distribution, product administration and data collection and analysis concerning the safety and effectiveness of the product. In issuing an EUA, the FDA considers the totality of available scientific evidence regarding quality, safety and efficacy, including the known and potential risks of such products and the adequacy and availability of approved alternatives, among other factors. An EUA is not a substitute for obtaining FDA approval, licensure, or clearance for use of a product. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates, and EUAs can be revoked under other circumstances, the timing of which may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict.
Outside the U.S., the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that differ from those in the U.S.
The COVID-19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the U.S. On the basis of such determination, the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA has granted EUAs for bamlanivimab, bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together, and baricitinib in combination with remdesivir, and similar actions have been taken by other regulators in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. We intend to submit bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to the FDA for approval in the second half of 2021.
Other Laws and Regulations
The marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with purchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws, as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations, including the federal anti-kickback statute, the False Claims Act, and state laws governing kickbacks, false claims, unfair trade practices, and consumer protection. These laws are administered by, among others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management, and state attorneys general. Over the past several years, state and federal governments have increased their oversight, enforcement activities, and intra-agency coordination with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Further, several claims brought by these agencies against us and other companies under these and other laws have resulted in corporate criminal sanctions and very substantial civil settlements.
In December 2020, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued final rules expanding and modifying existing, and adding new, regulatory “safe harbors” and exceptions, respectively, under the anti-kickback statute and the Ethics in Patient Referrals Act. We are currently evaluating the impact, if any, these regulatory amendments will have upon becoming effective on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position, which is uncertain at this time.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities, including U.S. publicly traded companies, from promising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above, outside the U.S., our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA.
14

In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and regulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years, several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and regulations in this area, increased their enforcement activities, and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing.
We are and could in the future become subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties (including treble damages under the False Claims Act), criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from U.S. federal and other health care programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, and financial position.
We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may affect our research, development or production efforts.
Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access
U.S.
There continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, and measures to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals are being considered at various levels of state and federal government. In addition, U.S. government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products. Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The regulatory priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration could further intensify these efforts, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.
In the U.S., we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and respective state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various federal and state healthcare programs, including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for price increases over time) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of health care facilities intended to serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B facilities). No rebates are required at this time in the Medicare Part B (physician and hospital outpatient) program where reimbursement is set on an “average sales price plus 4.3 percent” formula. Additionally, an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. Since 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act has required manufacturers of brand-name drugs, biologics, and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare Part D participants who are in the “doughnut hole” (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage), an increase from the previous 50 percent discount.
Rebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We pay rebates to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare and to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive products and generics in the same class. Our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers who provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by Medicare may be impacted by recent regulatory amendments included in the anti-kickback statute final rule that will become effective on January 1, 2023.
15

Outside the U.S.
Globally, public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value, including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition, third-party organizations, including professional associations, academic institutions, and non-profit entities associated with payers, are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit analyses on medicines, the impact of which are uncertain at this time.
In most international markets, we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs, which may include price controls, international reference pricing (to other countries’ prices), discounts and rebates, therapeutic reference pricing (to other, often generic, pharmaceutical choices), restrictions on physician prescription levels, and mandatory generic substitution. We may experience additional pricing pressures resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world.
We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative, regulatory, or payer developments. However, in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional state, federal, and international legislative and regulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products.
See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Other Matters - Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access” for additional information regarding recent legislative, administrative, and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results.
Research and Development
Our commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is critical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2020, we employed approximately 7,600 people in pharmaceutical research and development activities, including a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel.
Our internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of diabetes, oncology, immunology, neurodegeneration, and pain. During 2020, we also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for COVID-19. In addition to discovering and developing new medicines, we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses, formulations, and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to patients.
To supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We actively invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including, among others, licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments.
Pharmaceutical development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved medicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-stage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. The following describes in more detail the research and development process for pharmaceutical products:
Phases of New Drug Development
•Discovery Phase
In the discovery phase, scientists identify, design, and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play a role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to the next phase of development, which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research in humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low.
16

•Early Development Phase
Early development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is initially performed in laboratory tests and animals, as necessary. In general, the first human tests (often referred to as Phase I) are conducted in small groups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently, larger populations of patients are studied (Phase II) to identify initial signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel, scientists work to identify safe, effective, and economical manufacturing processes. Long-term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the candidates that enter the early development phase, approximately 10 percent move to the late development phase. The early development phase varies but can take several years to complete.
•Late Development Phase
Late phase development projects (typically Phase III) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies. As a result, these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and efficacy in the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to competitive therapies, placebo, or both. Phase III studies are generally conducted globally and are designed to support regulatory filings for marketing approval. The duration of Phase III testing varies by disease and may take two to four years.
•Submission Phase
Once a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies, the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several years, depending on the disease state, the strength and complexity of available data, the degree of unmet need, and the time required for the regulatory agency(ies) to evaluate the submission, which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors. There is no guarantee that a potential medicine will receive marketing approval, or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic areas.
We believe our investments in research, both internally and in collaboration with others, have resulted in a robust pipeline of potential new medicines and new treatment indications in all stages of development. We currently have approximately 45 candidates in clinical development or under regulatory review, and a larger number of projects in the discovery phase. See Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline,” for more information on certain of our product candidates.
Raw Materials and Product Supply
Most of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, we obtain certain raw or intermediate materials primarily from only one source. We generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply could be implemented, in the event one of these suppliers was unable to provide the materials or product. However, in the event of an extended failure of a supplier or significant unanticipated increases in demand on a supplier, it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new sources or, in some cases, implemented alternative processes.
The majority of our revenue comes from products produced in our own facilities. Our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at sites we own in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and Ireland. Finishing operations, including formulation, filling, assembling, delivery device manufacturing, and packaging, take place at a number of sites throughout the world. We utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operations.
17

We manage our supply chain (including our own facilities, contracted arrangements, and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes in supply and demand. To maintain a stable supply of our products, we use a variety of techniques including comprehensive quality systems, inventory management, and back-up sites.
However, pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals. Accordingly, if we were to experience unplanned plant shutdowns at one of our own facilities, significant failure of a contract supplier, or significant unanticipated increases in demand, we could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded.
In addition, COVID-19 could also have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations, global supply chain, and distribution systems, which could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products and affect the ability of third parties on which we rely to fulfill their obligations to us, and could increase our expenses. For more information, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce its spread have impacted, and may in future periods negatively impact, our business and operations.” and Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - COVID-19 Pandemic.”
Quality Assurance
Our success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness. Product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations, including research and development, purchasing, facilities planning, manufacturing, distribution, and dissemination of information about our medicines.
Quality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients, equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and labeling. We perform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory requirements and our internal standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals, or a combination thereof. Additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to pharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at third-party suppliers.

Human Capital Management
Our core values—integrity, excellence, and respect for people—shape our approach to attracting, retaining, engaging, and developing a highly skilled and ethical workforce, which is critical to executing our strategy. We believe the strength of our workforce significantly contributes to our financial performance and enables us to make life better for people around the world. For instance, most of the products we sell today were discovered or developed by our own scientists, and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative new medicines. We believe that fostering a positive culture that values the contributions of our talented colleagues helps drive our success.
We are committed to creating a safe, supportive, ethical, and rewarding work environment through strategic focus on our human capital management process, fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, robust training and development opportunities, and competitive pay and benefits. We believe our dedication to promoting diversity and inclusion (D&I) within our company reflects our values and is a key driver of business success and growth.
We regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics. These results are reviewed and analyzed by our leaders in order to implement changes to our policies and benefits designed to improve our employees' well-being. As a result of our efforts, we believe that we have a highly performing, cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good.
At the end of 2020, we employed approximately 35,000 people, including approximately 19,500 employees outside the U.S. Our employees include approximately 7,600 people engaged in research and development activities.
Strategy and Oversight
In order to build diverse and inclusive teams, our CEO and executive committee set expectations for inclusive leadership and hold leaders accountable for achieving results. Because dedication to human capital management is also a core component of our corporate governance, our board of directors regularly engages with management and facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital management initiatives and progress as part of the overarching framework that guides how we attract, retain, engage, and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and mission.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, and we deeply value diverse backgrounds, skills, and global perspectives. To fulfill our purpose, we believe we must look at challenges from multiple viewpoints and understand the diverse experiences of the patients who depend on us.
We believe that fostering D&I begins with understanding. For example, our Employee Journeys research has yielded important insights about the experiences of women, Black/African American, Latinx, Asian, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) employees at Lilly. The results of this research are reviewed by our senior leadership, and we deploy actions and activities in response to these insights to improve our workplace and corporate culture.
Since 2017, we have committed to increasing the number of women, Black/African American, Latinx, and Asian populations in leadership roles, and we actively monitor our progress. From the end of 2017 through the end of 2020, we increased the number of women in management globally from 41 percent to 46 percent. For minority group members (MGM) in the U.S. over the same period, we increased management representation from 16 percent to 22 percent. Across all levels of our workforce, from the end of 2017 through the end of 2020, we have seen increased representation for MGMs in the U.S. and women globally. Our focus on D&I is also evident at our executive committee and board of directors. Seven of 15 members (approximately 47 percent) of our executive committee (which includes our CEO) are women and two are MGM, including one MGM woman. In addition, the company’s 15-member board of directors includes six women and seven members of underrepresented groups (including MGM as well as LGBTQ individuals).
20

Our efforts in D&I and workplace benefits have garnered numerous recognitions, including, in 2020 and early 2021, Top 50 Companies for Diversity by DiversityInc., America’s Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes, America’s Most JUST Companies and Forbes JUST 100 by Forbes and JUST Capital, Perfect Score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index (2020 and 2021), World’s Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere, Leading Disability Employer by the National Organization on Disability, Top Employers by Science Magazine, America’s Most Responsible Companies by Newsweek, and 100 Best Companies, Top 75 Companies for Executive Women, Best Companies for Dads, and Best Companies for Multicultural Women by Working Mother Magazine.
Employee Development
We believe talent begins with the hiring process. We therefore require hiring managers to consider a diverse pool of candidates and we strive to provide a diverse panel of interviewers for open positions. We believe that hiring in this way helps ensure that people from all backgrounds have equal opportunity to advance their careers.
We offer training to enable our employees to perform their duties in our highly regulated industry. We also strive to cultivate a culture that promotes ongoing learning by encouraging employees to seek further education and growth experiences, helping them build rewarding careers. We have introduced online programming to facilitate access to our learning and development offerings. Many training courses are designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and other unique needs. Across Lilly, we are working to design learning experiences to be more inclusive and effective.
To further improve our talent programs and processes, in 2019, we introduced Explore Your Career, a global framework of tools and resources for our employees. We believe Explore Your Career provides broader access and transparency about career development and advancement at Lilly. In 2018, we introduced Emerge, a three-day program led by our CEO that is designed to develop MGM talent at Lilly, and three cohorts comprising Black/African American women, Latinx and Asian women, and MGM men have participated in this enterprise-level program since its inception. Lilly also offers established leadership development programs for women and earlier career multi-cultural talent, as well as leaders at all levels.
Employee resource groups (ERGs) are another important component of developing talent at Lilly. We currently have 10 ERGs representing groups including women, MGMs, LGBTQ individuals, and people with disabilities. ERGs offer our diverse workforce opportunities to build relationships, engage with senior leaders, advance our caring community, and offer unique insights and perspectives to improve our business. Membership in our ERGs continues to grow, with an estimated 11,430 people participating worldwide at the end of 2020.
In furtherance of our efforts to create an inclusive workplace, in 2020 we expanded Make it Safe to Thrive, an education and awareness program to help employees and leaders understand how individual psychological safety can be created and enhanced, with the goal of ensuring that all employees feel safe to speak up and to share their ideas at work. The program includes live and online training and a monthly video series.
Employee Health and Safety
While we have consistently focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees, the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the importance of this critical priority. In response to the pandemic, we have taken measures to protect our workforce, maximize social distancing, and inform employees about our policies. For example, we instituted travel restrictions and remote working arrangements for employees whose roles do not require on-site presence. To support employee well-being in the U.S., we enhanced local benefits related to health care, childcare, and time off, and expanded reimbursement for home office ergonomic support expenditures. In the U.S., we provide full coverage for COVID-19 diagnostic testing and treatment, and at our corporate headquarters in Indianapolis, we provide free on-site testing for employees and members of their household. In addition, as part of our Make it Safe to Thrive program, we partnered with our ERGs to offer a series of programs highlighting and addressing challenges faced by ERG members during the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to build understanding of different experiences and to offer ways to be inclusive.

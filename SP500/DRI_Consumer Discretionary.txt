Darden Restaurants, Inc. is a Florida corporation incorporated in March 1995, and is the parent company of GMRI, Inc., also a Florida corporation. GMRI, Inc. and certain other of our subsidiaries own and operate our restaurants. GMRI, Inc. was originally incorporated in March 1968 as Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. We were acquired by General Mills, Inc. in 1970 and became a separate publicly held company in 1995 when General Mills distributed all of our outstanding stock to the stockholders of General Mills. Our principal executive offices and restaurant support center are located at 1000 Darden Center Drive, Orlando, Florida 32837, telephone (407) 245-4000. Our corporate website address is www.darden.com. We make our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, Section 16 reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5, and all amendments to those reports available free of charge on our website the same day as the reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “Darden,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” include Darden Restaurants, Inc., GMRI, Inc. and our respective subsidiaries.

We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending the last Sunday in May. Our fiscal year 2020 ended May 31, 2020 and consisted of 53 weeks, fiscal 2019 ended May 26, 2019 and consisted of 52 weeks, and fiscal 2018 ended May 27, 2018 and consisted of 52 weeks.
The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information in Part II of this report under the caption “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
COVID-19 Pandemic
In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a national public health emergency resulting in a significant reduction in guest traffic at our restaurants due to changes in consumer behavior as public health officials encouraged social distancing and state and local governments mandated restrictions including suspension of dine-in operations, reduced restaurant seating capacity, table spacing requirements, bar closures and additional physical barriers. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, our financial results were strong as sales from continuing operations for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 were $6.54 billion, an

1


increase of 4.1 percent over the prior year period. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted this strong performance, and for most of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we operated with all of our dining rooms closed and served our guests in a To Go only or To Go and delivery format. Our sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 declined 43.0 percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. As we continue to navigate through the pandemic, we have taken significant steps to adapt our business to allow us to continue to serve guests, support our team members and secure our liquidity position to provide financial flexibility, including:
•
Modifying our business operations in order to continue serving guests at our restaurants as safely and effectively as possible, including, initially transitioning all restaurant locations to a To Go only or To Go and delivery model;
•
Reducing or eliminating fixed costs in our restaurants and restaurant support center as well as eliminating or delaying most nonessential capital spending;
•
Furloughing a substantial number of hourly restaurant employees as a result of the closure of our dining rooms and reduction in sales;
•
Protecting our team members’ safety and wellbeing, including sourcing additional sanitation supplies and personal protective equipment, implementing paid sick leave for all hourly restaurant team members, providing a $75.0 million emergency pay program and covering $4.1 million of health and welfare insurance premiums for furloughed team members;
•
Suspending the quarterly cash dividend, with the intention of reviewing our dividend policy as developments warrant;
•
Fully drawing on our $750.0 million Revolving Credit Agreement, which was subsequently repaid in May 2020;
•
Securing a $270.0 million term loan;
•
Raising $505.1 million in net proceeds from a follow-on equity offering;
•
Suspending our share repurchase activity; and
•
Implementing a careful, phased reopening of our dining rooms where permitted by local regulations.
The impact on our operating results as well as the operational and financial measures we have implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have been included throughout this document. In late April 2020, state and local governments began to allow us to open dining rooms at limited capacities, along with other operating restrictions, and as of the date of filing this report, 89.0 percent of our restaurants were able to open their dining rooms to some extent. While increasing our in-restaurant dining capacity is subject to the ordinances in the jurisdictions where we operate, we are focused on increasing capacity where possible, continuing to provide a safe environment for our team members and guests, and maintaining many of the efficiencies established over these past few months. For most of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, our cash flows from operations were negative, but by the end of the quarter, with the increasing dining room capacity, we were back to near break-even cash flow levels. Although we expect our restaurants’ dining room capacity to increase as public health conditions improve and restrictions are eased, it is possible additional outbreaks could require us to reduce our capacity or further suspend our in-restaurant dining operations.
Segment Information
We manage our restaurant brands in North America as operating segments. The brands operate principally in the U.S. within full-service dining. We aggregate our operating segments into reportable segments based on a combination of the size, economic characteristics and sub-segment of full-service dining within which each brand operates. We have four reportable segments: 1) Olive Garden, 2) LongHorn Steakhouse, 3) Fine Dining (which includes The Capital Grille and Eddie V’s) and 4) Other Business (which includes Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52 and results from our franchise operations). External sales are derived principally from food and beverage sales, we do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales and the customers and long-lived assets of our reportable segments are predominantly in the U.S. There were no material transactions among reportable segments.

Strategy
We believe that capable operators of strong multi-unit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the restaurant industry’s full-service segment. Generally, the restaurant industry is considered to be comprised of three segments: quick service, fast casual, and full-service. All of our restaurants fall within the full-service segment, which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains. We believe we have strong brands, and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full-service restaurant industry. This collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business, including restaurant operations excellence, brand management excellence, supply chain, talent management and information technology, among other things.
Although the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 required us to focus on adapting our business to account for the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, our operating philosophy remains focused on strengthening the core operational fundamentals of the business by providing an outstanding guest experience rooted in culinary innovation, attentive service, engaging atmosphere, and integrated marketing. Darden enables each brand to reach its full potential by leveraging its scale, insights, and experience in a way that protects uniqueness and competitive advantages. Additionally, our brands can capitalize on data insights to deliver customized one-to-one customer relationship marketing. We hold ourselves accountable for operating our restaurants with a sense of urgency to achieve our commitments to all of our stakeholders.

Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen capital investments are based on costs associated with land-only leases; Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze and Eddie V’s capital investments are based on ground and building leases. Actual costs can vary significantly depending on the specific location.

(6)
Fiscal 2020 restaurant openings include one The Capital Burger restaurant. Pro-forma new restaurant data excludes The Capital Burger.

While our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands, the actual number of openings for each of our brands for fiscal 2021 will depend on many factors, including local operating restrictions related to COVID-19, our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, obtain necessary local governmental permits, complete construction, and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel.
We consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s long-term success, and we devote significant effort to the site selection process. Prior to entering a market, we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants. Our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the site’s visibility, accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition. Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after the site is acquired and permits are obtained.
We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement operational and marketing plans to improve that restaurant’s performance. If performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other brands. Permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas, the expiration of lease agreements, or site concerns. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges.

Restaurant Operations
We believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success. Our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size. We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards.
The management structures below describe our restaurant operations during the normal and fully operational conditions that were in place for the first three quarters of fiscal 2020. As the COVID-19 pandemic began affecting our business, the staffing requirements of each restaurant varied widely as all dining rooms closed for portions of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and then changed further as dining rooms began reopening with various opening configurations towards the end of the quarter. As our restaurant operations continue to evolve in response to the pandemic, we are evaluating our operational structure and making adjustments where appropriate. As a result, the descriptions below may not reflect the current or future structure of our restaurant operations.
Each Olive Garden restaurant is led by a general manager, and each LongHorn Steakhouse and Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen restaurant is led by a managing partner. Each also has three to six additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. In addition, each restaurant typically employs between 60 to 175 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time. Restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately five to ten restaurants. Each director of operations reports to a Senior Vice President of Operations who is responsible for between 80 and 100 restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement.
Each Yard House and Bahama Breeze restaurant is led by a general manager, and each The Capital Grille, The Capital Burger, Seasons 52 and Eddie V’s restaurant is led by a managing partner. Each has two to eight managers. Each Yard House, The Capital Grille, The Capital Burger, Seasons 52 and Eddie V’s restaurant has one executive chef, and one to two sous chefs, and each Bahama Breeze restaurant has one to three culinary managers. In addition, each restaurant typically employs between 65 to 200 hourly team members, most of whom work part-time. The general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations, who has operational responsibility for approximately three to eleven restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards and to solicit feedback on opportunities for improvement.
Our Learning and Employee Development team in partnership with each brand’s training leader, together with senior operations executives, is responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs. These efforts include a 10 to 12-week training program for management trainees and continuing development programs for all levels of leadership. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand, but includes leadership, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants, including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations. The opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening. They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff.
We maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our management-level team members. We believe that our leadership position, strong results-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock-based compensation, enhances our ability to attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.
Quality Assurance
Our Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment.
Food Safety and our Total Quality Program
Through rigorous supplier and risk-based product evaluations, we purchase only products that meet or exceed our product specifications. We rely on independent third parties to inspect and evaluate our suppliers and distributors. Suppliers that produce “high-risk” products are subject to a food safety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually. We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) food safety programs and risk-based preventative controls adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met. We require routine food safety verification for high-risk products from our suppliers. Our total quality

7


managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant regularly throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation. The total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety.
Restaurant, Guest and Team Member Safety in Response to COVID-19
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have enhanced restaurant safety practices and made other enhancements to our operations to comply with state and local government regulations and health recommendations to ensure team member wellness, maintain clean restaurants, practice social distancing and wear protective equipment. Some of our COVID-19 enhanced procedures include:
•All team members are being screened to ensure they are symptom-free before returning to work, and we are conducting daily health and temperature checks at every restaurant before team members are allowed to begin their shift. We provide paid sick leave for our restaurant team members so that they can stay home if they do not feel well.
•Prior to welcoming guests back into our dining rooms following our temporary dining room closures, we thoroughly cleaned and sanitized each of our restaurant buildings using proven procedures and processes known to protect against contagious viruses like COVID-19. In addition to our already strict restaurant cleaning procedures, which exceed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, we have continued to regularly disinfect all guest and team member touchpoints using our CDC-approved disinfectant. These include, but are not limited to: disinfecting guest tables after each use, as well as regularly disinfecting table top tablets, check presenters, menus, pens, restrooms, door handles and other common surfaces.
•We have and continue to reconfigure our dining rooms to create more space between tables. We are also taking steps to ensure there is no congregating in our lobby and bar areas where regulations require.
•In accordance with the CDC’s guidance regarding face coverings and many state and local orders, we require all team members to wear masks. Our culinary team members wear gloves, and all team members will continue to practice frequent and effective handwashing.
•Third party auditors also ensure that restaurant team members are adhering to COVID-19 preventive guidelines.
Purchasing and Distribution
Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of safe, high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement. Our purchasing staff sources, negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 1,500 suppliers whose products originate in more than 35 countries. Suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and strategic supplier relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken the following steps to enhance the safety and reliability of our supply chain.
•Safety:    The Company’s cross functional COVID-19 task force implemented CDC-based guidelines for restaurants described in Quality Assurance, above. We also implemented and communicated guidelines for our distributors and other suppliers providing services inside our restaurants, including required use of personal protective equipment (PPE). To support these enhanced safety protocols, we secured a supply of the necessary volumes of PPE and cleaning products for our restaurants and team members.
•Sourcing: As we transitioned to increased To Go business during the temporary closure of our dining rooms, we secured supplies of new and additional packaging products to better support food and beverage transport. We also sourced alternate formats of alcohol beverages for To Go in order to comply with state laws that permitted To Go sales of alcohol. To mitigate the potential risk of geographic trade disruptions, we created contingency plans in anticipation of supply chain obstacles. The purchasing team also mitigated obsolete/expiring inventory exposure by selling products to retail outlets.
•Distribution: We increased inventory levels for brand-critical items, restaurant cleaning products, and PPE supplies to ensure sufficient supply of necessary products. An internal cross-functional team was created specifically to ensure successful restaurant ramp-down and quick reopening support.
We believe that our significant scale is a competitive advantage and our purchasing team leverages this purchasing capability. Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source top-quality food products

8


at competitive prices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are monitoring our suppliers remotely, hosting virtual visits with potential new suppliers and conducting virtual request for proposal processes. We believe that we have established excellent long-term relationships with key suppliers and usually source our product directly from producers (not brokers or middlemen). We actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that we incorporate women- and minority-owned businesses in our purchasing decisions.
We have entered into long-term agreements with multiple third-party national distribution companies to deliver food and supplies to our restaurants. Under these arrangements we maintain ownership of the food and supplies inventory through our subsidiary Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. (Darden Direct). This inventory is stored in distribution company warehouses that are wholly or primarily dedicated to Darden where practical to do so. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales.
We continue to drive automation of our supply chain by collaborating with our suppliers, logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility and other technological advances. These and other terms of Darden Direct’s long-term supply agreements further enable our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into our purchasing operations, driving efficiencies in our operations.
Advertising and Marketing
Integrated marketing is a key element of our strategy, and our scale enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full-service dining segment of the restaurant industry. Olive Garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising, supplemented with cable, local television and digital advertising. LongHorn Steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to build engagement and loyalty by market. Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Yard House, The Capital Grille, Seasons 52, Bahama Breeze and Eddie V’s do not use television advertising, but rely on local and digital marketing. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we significantly reduced our television advertising spending and directed our marketing efforts towards growing and promoting our To Go options and off-premise dining business. Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to build awareness and strengthen our brands’ relevance. We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits, as well as increase frequency of visitation by our guests. We also rely on outdoor billboard, direct mail and email advertising, as well as radio, newspapers, digital coupons, search engine marketing and social media such as Facebook® and Instagram®, as appropriate, to attract, engage and retain our guests. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving food service trends and marketplace dynamics.
In fiscal 2020, we continued a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that allow us to digitally engage with our guests and team members and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in an increasingly connected society.  We also continued making improvements to our online and mobile ordering system for Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse and accelerated rollout of online and mobile ordering and payment systems across all of our other brands.    In addition, we continued working on developing sophisticated customer relationship management programs, data analytics, and data-driven marketing approaches to effectively and efficiently target our existing and potential guests across our portfolio of brands.  This enables us to tailor our messaging and offerings depending on guest visit history, preferences and brand loyalty.
Employees
At the end of fiscal 2020, we employed approximately 177,000 people (team members) in the United States and Canada. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the temporary closure of all of our dining rooms discussed above, we placed many restaurant and corporate team members on furlough for portions of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020.  At the highest point during that quarter, approximately 150,000 team members were on furlough, but that number had reduced to 95,000 as of the end of fiscal 2020, as local and state governments began permitting the reopening of dining rooms throughout the month of May 2020. Of the 177,000 total team members, approximately 167,000 were hourly restaurant personnel. The remainder were restaurant management personnel located in the restaurants or in the field, or were located at our restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida.
Our executives have an average of 16 years of experience with Darden. The restaurant general managers and managing partners average 13 years with us. We believe that we provide working conditions and pay and benefits that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most team members, other than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. None of our team members are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.
As a full-service restaurant company, food is always top of mind, but our team members make the difference: they are at the heart of everything we do. We believe the guest experience can never exceed the team member experience, so we hire the best and retain them by fostering an environment of respect, where diversity of thought and background is valued and everyone has the

9


opportunity to develop and grow their careers. We offer our team members flexible work schedules and competitive pay and benefits, including paid sick leave, which we introduced in March 2020.
Consistent with one of our core values of diversity, we are committed to attracting, retaining, engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests. Approximately 51 percent of our hourly restaurant team members are minorities and 56 percent are female. Additionally, we employ members of five generations of the United States population: Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials and Centennials.
Consistent with our core values of respect and caring and teamwork, in fiscal 1999 we established a program called Darden Dimes to help fellow Darden team members in need.  Darden Dimes provides short-term financial grants to team members experiencing financial need caused by unexpected emergencies or catastrophic natural disasters. Participating team members donate as little as 10 cents from each paycheck to the Darden Dimes fund, which raises and grants more than $1.5 million annually.
We succeed because of our people, and with our success come rewards, recognition and great opportunities for our team members. We invest in their careers every step of the way by providing the tools they need to succeed in their current roles, to grow personally and professionally, and to deliver exceptional experiences to our guests each day. With thousands of leadership positions across our restaurants, we provide a pathway and training for thousands of individuals across the country to advance from entry-level jobs into management roles. In addition, our geographic footprint often puts us in a position to offer our restaurant team members jobs in their current roles when personal circumstances require relocation. This is one of the reasons Darden has enjoyed the lowest annual turnover rates for hourly team members in the industry. While we are experiencing unprecedented circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic, our people first philosophy stands firm and we will continue to find and offer growth opportunities to team members aspiring for more in their careers.
Information Technology and Cybersecurity
We strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy.  We have implemented technology-enabled business solutions to improve financial control, cost management, guest service and employee effectiveness, as well as enable e-commerce. These solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand. Our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence. Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida.  Our data network sends and receives business data to and from the restaurants throughout the day and night, providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location.  Our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently.  Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both our data and the physical computing assets.  We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, testing the disaster recovery plan at a host-site facility and providing on-site power backup. We also conduct a third-party security review of our network and systems on a regular basis.  We use internally developed proprietary software, cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated implementation of online ordering and payment for brands that did not previously provide this option, including Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, Seasons 52, The Capital Grille, and Eddie V’s. All Darden brands now share a secure, robust digital platform with online ordering and other guest-facing capabilities. We will continue to leverage our digital platform to address changing guest needs. Additionally, we made changes to our restaurant systems that were necessary to efficiently support increasing demand for To Go and curbside pickup orders and to facilitate social distancing requirements once dining rooms started to reopen.
We maintain a robust system of data protection and cybersecurity resources, technology and processes. We remain constantly vigilant of new and emerging risks and ever-changing legal and compliance requirements and make strategic continued investments in those systems to keep Company, guest and team member data secure. We monitor risks of sensitive information compromise at our business partners where relevant and reevaluate those relationships if necessary. We provide annual security awareness training to our management and restaurant support center team members. We also provide annual credit card handling training following Payment Card Industry (PCI) guidelines to all team members that handle guest credit cards.
Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates positions us well to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. We provide data protection and cybersecurity reports to the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors on a quarterly basis and periodically to the full Board of Directors. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.

Competition
The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, availability of carryout and home delivery, internet and mobile ordering capabilities and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers convenient meals in the form of improved entrées, side dishes or meal preparation kits from the deli or prepared foods sections. In addition, improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants and expansion of home delivery services, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.
Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “Purchasing and Distribution,” “Advertising and Marketing” and “Information Technology and Cybersecurity” in this Item 1 and in our Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We regard our Olive Garden®, LongHorn Steakhouse®, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen®, Yard House®, The Capital Grille®, The Capital Burger ®, Seasons 52®, Bahama Breeze®, Eddie V’s Prime Seafood®, Darden® and Darden Restaurants® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to vigorously oppose any infringement of them. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.
Franchises, Joint Ventures and New Business Development
As of May 31, 2020, we operated 1,804 restaurants through subsidiaries in the United States and Canada. We own all of those locations, except for 3 restaurants managed by us and owned by joint ventures in which we hold a majority ownership. We control the joint ventures’ use of our service marks and the joint ventures pay management fees to us, which are not material to our consolidated financial statements.
As of May 31, 2020, franchisees operated 30 franchised restaurants in the United States and 32 franchised restaurants outside of the United States. We have area development, franchise and/or license agreements in place with unaffiliated operators to develop and operate Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille and Bahama Breeze restaurants in the following regions:
•
United States,
•
Middle East (Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates),
•
Mexico,
•
Central and South America (Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama), and
•
Philippines
The open and operating franchised restaurants are all reflected in the table under the “Introduction” section of this Item 1. We do not have an ownership interest in any of these franchisees, but we receive fees under the area development and franchise agreements and royalty income under the franchise or license agreements. The amount of income we derive from our franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
We license the sales and distribution of several items including Olive Garden salad dressings, salad croutons, LongHorn Steakhouse seasoning and Olive Garden seasoning through various channels including wholesale distribution chains and major grocery chains. The amount of income we derive from these licensing arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements.
Seasonality
Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. Typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the winter and spring, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall. Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. We are not able to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on the seasonality of our business.


11


Government Regulation

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a panoply of federal, state and local government regulations affecting our business to be issued and frequently revised on a daily and/or weekly basis beginning in March 2020 and continuing through the date of this report. Regulations relating to paid sick leave, opening and closing of bars, restaurants and dining rooms, business hours, sanitation practices, To Go alcohol sales, guest spacing within dining rooms and other social distancing practices and PPE usage by both team members and guests have materially affected the way we operate our business and serve our guests.
During fiscal 2020, 11.4 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, many states modified their regulations to permit To Go sales of alcoholic beverages, and during the temporary closure of our restaurants we offered a variety of alcoholic beverages, including in bottles, from draft and mixed drinks To Go. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these alcoholic beverage licenses or to comply with regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations. We also are subject in certain states to “dram shop” statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance.

We also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions, paid leave, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices.

Since 1995, Darden has had a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (TRAC) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service.  TRAC requirements, which include increased educational and other efforts in each restaurant to increase the reporting compliance of employees with respect to cash tips, are applied across all of our brands.  Compliance with TRAC requirements reduces the likelihood of potential employer-only FICA tax assessments related to cash tips that are unreported by employees at Darden’s covered units. Consistent with our long-standing agreement with the IRS, we work proactively with IRS personnel responsible for tip compliance to ensure that we are taking the appropriate steps to continue to meet our TRAC obligations.  

We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2020, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.

Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.

We are subject to federal and state regulations relating to employer-provided health insurance, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. We continue to monitor the status of the health care reform discussions at the federal and state levels.

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content.

We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. As a merchant and service provider of point-of-sale services, we are also subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard issued by the Payment Card Industry Council (PCI DSS).


12


We are subject to anti-corruption laws in the United States and in the international jurisdictions where we do business, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. We are also subject to a variety of international laws relating to franchising and licensing of intellectual property in the various countries across the world where we are engaged in franchising our restaurant brands.

See Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of health care reform, data privacy and environmental matters.

Sustainability

The sustainability of our food sources and restaurant operations is a key component of providing great service and food to our guests. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated that we focus on business critical items in the short-term, but we continue to believe that sustainability contributes to our overall business success over the long-term. We will continue to adapt our approach in the current economic environment with intent to return to our integrated and strategic priorities in the near term across the enterprise, from the food we source to the operation of our restaurants. 

We are proud to operate some of the most efficient restaurants in the United States. Darden manages energy and water conservation within our restaurant operations. Over the last decade we have realized a 15% reduction in energy use per restaurant and a 20% reduction in water usage on average per restaurant, and we continue to realize cost savings from historical reductions in our daily operating costs. Darden continues to reduce landfill waste by minimizing food loss and optimizing food donation programs across all of our restaurants. In fiscal 2019, we conducted an in-depth waste characterization at Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse to continue to optimize waste diversion programs. As our portfolio has grown over time, we have done so sustainably. Since 2008, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions per restaurant by 18 percent, as measured in accordance with the Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

We shared Darden’s Food Principles in 2016 to outline our commitment to guests in areas of sustainable sourcing, nutritional disclosure, food safety and animal welfare. Darden’s Food Principles connect each of these strategic business efforts in a guest-centered platform, including sourcing and ingredient commitments to our guests. We have set commitments related to the following food attributes: animal welfare, chickens raised without medically-important antibiotics, cage-free eggs and gestation crate-free pork. We are on track to meet our Food Principles commitments and we continue to monitor progress with our suppliers.
Building on our Food Principles, Darden established an Animal Welfare Policy that adopts an outcomes-based approach to continue to ensure high level of care for farm animals in the food supply chain. In support of the Policy, we established and convened our first Animal Welfare Council session with key academics and thought leaders with expertise in the care of animals in food supply chains.  The Council advises on and will support Darden’s efforts to advance strategy and implementation of an outcomes-based approach, from supplier collaborations to reporting improvements.  The COVID-19 pandemic has prevented us from additional convening in 2020, but we expect to continue our efforts with the Council when feasible.
More information about our sustainability strategy, our commitment to our guests on Food Principles and our progress to date is available at www.darden.com.

Darden Foundation and Community Affairs
We are recognized for a culture that rewards caring for and responding to people. That defines service for Darden. The Darden Restaurants, Inc. Foundation (Foundation) works to bring to life this spirit of service through its philanthropic support of charitable organizations across the country as well as the volunteer involvement of our team members. The Foundation does this by focusing its philanthropic efforts on programs that enhance the communities in which our team members and guests live and work. In addition, team members at the Darden Restaurant Support Center are eligible for 16 hours per calendar year of paid time for approved community service activities during scheduled work hours.
In fiscal 2020, the Foundation awarded approximately $3.8 million in grants to national organizations as well as local nonprofits including Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida and the Heart of Florida United Way. These organizations provide service to the public through hunger relief, community engagement, disaster preparedness and the promotion of career opportunities in the culinary industry.
The Foundation continued its partnership with Feeding America in fiscal 2020 with a $2.0 million grant to provide food to hungry families in the communities where we do business. The Foundation’s contribution will support food banks across the country and help provide meals for people facing hunger. This donation will mark a total of $9.8 million that the Foundation and Darden have contributed to the Feeding America network over the past decade.
Our support of Feeding America and the fight against hunger goes hand-in-hand with our Darden Harvest program, which began in 2003 as a mechanism for delivering fresh and healthy food to people who need it. Each day, across every one of our restaurants, we collect surplus, wholesome food that is not served to guests and, rather than discarding the food, we prepare it for donation to local nonprofit feeding partners. In fiscal 2020, Darden contributed approximately 6.3 million pounds of food, the equivalent of more than 5 million meals provided to people in need across the communities served by our restaurants. As an added benefit of the Darden Harvest program, we are able to divert millions of pounds of surplus food from waste streams every year, making the Darden Harvest program a key part of our goal to one day send zero waste to landfills.
The Foundation’s funding also helps support the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation’s ProStart program, a national high school program that introduces students to the restaurant industry and provides them with an industry-driven curriculum on topics ranging from culinary techniques to management skills. The Foundation’s $250,000 annual contribution also supports the Opportunity Youth-Restaurant Ready program to engage and encourage disconnected young people to pursue a path to employment and improve their quality of life. In fiscal 2020, the Foundation donated an additional $200,000 to the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation to endow a scholarship fund for students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Each year, four graduating seniors from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School pursuing degrees in restaurant, hospitality or foodservice related programs will be eligible to receive a scholarship at a post-secondary educational institution in honor of those hospitality connected students who lost their lives in the 2018 tragedy.
We are a proud member of the American Red Cross’ Annual Disaster Giving Program, which enables the Red Cross to respond to the needs of individuals and families impacted by disasters anywhere in the United States. In fiscal 2020, the Foundation provided $500,000 to the American Red Cross for the program. In addition to financial support, our restaurants regularly donate meals to feed first responders and victims of natural disasters.
More information about the Foundation and its efforts to enhance the quality of life in the communities where we do business is available on our website at www.darden.com.

Hess Corporation, incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1920, is a global E&P company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), Malaysia, and Denmark. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we have announced eighteen significant discoveries. The Liza Phase 1 development achieved first production in December 2019, and reached its nameplate production capacity of approximately 120,000 gross bopd in December 2020. The Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned in the second quarter of 2019 and is expected to achieve first production by early 2022, with production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd. A third development, Payara, was sanctioned in the third quarter of 2020 and is expected to achieve first production in 2024, with production capacity of approximately 220,000 gross bopd. The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin up to ten FPSOs with the first five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2026.
Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2020, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. See Midstream on page 12.

(b)Other includes our interests in Denmark and Libya. Net production from Libya was 1.6 million boe for 2020 (2019: 7.8 million boe; 2018: 7.4 million boe). Net production from Denmark was 2.2 million boe for 2020 (2019: 2.6 million boe; 2018: 2.7 million boe).
(c)In August 2018, we sold our interests in the Utica shale play, onshore U.S.  Utica net production was 3.3 million boe in 2018.
E&P Operations
At December 31, 2020, our significant E&P assets included the following:
United States
Our production in the U.S. was from the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota (Bakken) and from offshore properties in the Gulf of Mexico.
North Dakota:
Bakken:  At December 31, 2020, we held approximately 532,000 net acres in the Bakken with varying working interest percentages.  Net production averaged 193,000 boepd in 2020.  We operated six rigs in the Bakken through May, before reducing to one rig for the remainder of 2020 in response to the sharp decline in oil prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We drilled 71 wells and brought 111 wells on production, bringing the total operated production wells to 1,686 by year-end.  We reduced the average cost of a plug and perf well in 2020 to $6.2 million per well from $6.8 million per well in 2019.  
During 2021, we plan to operate two rigs, drill approximately 55 wells and bring approximately 45 wells on production.  We forecast net production to average approximately 170,000 boepd for the full year 2021.  In 2021, the Tioga Gas Plant will be shut down for approximately 45 days for a planned maintenance turnaround and tie-in of the plant expansion project completed in 2020 which will increase gas processing capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from 250 million cubic feet per day.  The shutdown is expected to reduce 2021 average net production, mostly natural gas, by approximately 7,500 boepd.

Offshore:
Gulf of Mexico:  At December 31, 2020, we held approximately 61,000 net developed acres, with our production operations principally at the Baldpate (Hess 50%), Conger (Hess 38%), Hack Wilson (Hess 25%), Llano (Hess 50%), Penn State (Hess 50%), Stampede (Hess 25%) and Tubular Bells (Hess 57%) fields.  At December 31, 2020, we held approximately 286,000 net undeveloped acres, of which leases covering approximately 112,000 acres are due to expire in the next three years.
In November 2020, we completed the sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi Field for net proceeds of $482 million, after closing adjustments. Our net share of production from the Shenzi Field during 2020 was 9,000 boepd.
We participated in two outside operated exploration wells that were completed in 2020, the Oldfield-1 well and the Galapagos Deep well, both located in the Mississippi Canyon area. Both wells were unsuccessful.
Guyana
Stabroek Block:  The Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, covers approximately 6.6 million acres.  The operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, has made eighteen significant discoveries since 2015.  The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin the potential for up to ten FPSOs with the first five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2026.
The Liza Phase 1 development, which was sanctioned in 2017, began producing oil in December 2019 from the Liza Destiny FPSO and reached its nameplate production capacity of 120,000 gross bopd in December 2020. The Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned in 2019 and will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected by early 2022.  A total of 30 wells are planned at six drill centers, including 15 production wells, nine water injection wells and six gas injection wells. In 2021, the operator plans to continue development drilling, complete installation of subsea flow lines and equipment, complete installation of topside facilities on the FPSO and sail the Liza Unity FPSO from Singapore to the Liza Field.
On September 30, 2020, we announced the final investment decision to proceed with development of the Payara Field on the Stabroek Block after the development plan received approval from the government of Guyana. Payara will utilize the Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected in 2024. Ten drill centers with a total of 41 wells are planned, including 20 production wells and 21 injection wells. Excluding pre-sanction costs and FPSO purchase cost, our net share of development costs is forecast to be approximately $1.8 billion.
The operator is currently utilizing four drillships for exploration, appraisal and development drilling activities, and intends to bring in a fifth and sixth drillship in 2021.
In 2020, the following exploration and appraisal wells were drilled on the Stabroek Block (in chronological order):
Uaru:  The Uaru-1 well encountered approximately 94 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and is located approximately 10 miles northeast of the Liza Field.  
Yellowtail: The Yellowtail-2 well encountered approximately 69 feet of high-quality oil-bearing reservoirs and is located adjacent to and below the Yellowtail-1 discovery.
Redtail: The Redtail-1 well encountered approximately 232 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone and is located approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Yellowtail discovery.
In 2021, the operator completed drilling of the Hassa-1 well. The Hassa-1 well encountered approximately 50 feet of oil bearing reservoir in deeper geologic intervals, although the well did not encounter oil in the primary target areas. The operator plans to drill an additional 12 to 15 exploration and appraisal wells in 2021 that will target a variety of prospects and play types. These will include both lower risk wells near existing discoveries and higher risk step-out wells, and several penetrations that will test deeper Lower Campanian and Santonian intervals.
Kaieteur Block:  In 2018, we acquired a participating interest in the Kaieteur Block (Hess 15%), which is adjacent to the Stabroek Block. In 2020, the operator, Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited, completed drilling of the Tanager-1 exploration well. The well did encounter hydrocarbons but was not a commercial success on a stand-alone basis.

Malaysia and JDA
Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA):  Production comes from the Carigali Hess operated Block A-18 in the Malaysia/Thailand joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand (Hess 50%).  A multi-year drilling program is planned to commence in the first half of 2021.
Malaysia:  Our production in Malaysia comes from our interest in Block PM302 (Hess 50%) located in the North Malay Basin (NMB), offshore Peninsular Malaysia and Block PM301 (Hess 50%), which is adjacent to and is unitized with Block A‑18 of the JDA. In 2021, we plan to continue drilling and development activities at NMB.
Other
Denmark:  Production comes from our operated interest in the South Arne Field (Hess 62%).
Libya:  At the onshore Waha concession in Libya, which includes the Defa, Faregh, Gialo, North Gialo and Belhedan fields (Hess 8%), net production averaged 4,000 boepd in 2020, 21,000 boepd in 2019 and 20,000 boepd in 2018. Production was shut-in by the operator between January and October of 2020 due to force majeure caused by civil unrest. The Company’s net investment in Libya was approximately $85 million at December 31, 2020.
Suriname:  We hold a 33% non-operated participating interest in Block 42, offshore Suriname.  In 2022, the operator, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, plans to drill an exploration well.  We also hold a 33% non-operated participating interest in Block 59, offshore Suriname, where the operator, ExxonMobil Exploration and Production Suriname B.V., is interpreting recently acquired 2D seismic and is planning a 3D seismic acquisition.
Canada:  We hold a 50% non-operated participating interest in four exploration licenses offshore Nova Scotia and a 25% non-operated participating interest in three exploration licenses offshore Newfoundland.  In 2023, the operator, BP Canada, plans to drill one exploration well in Newfoundland.
Sales Commitments
We have certain long-term contracts with fixed minimum sales volume commitments for natural gas and NGL production.  At the JDA in the Gulf of Thailand, we have annual minimum net sales commitments of approximately 80 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2025 and approximately 40 billion cubic feet per year in 2026 and 2027.  At the North Malay Basin development project offshore Peninsular Malaysia, we have annual net sales commitments of approximately 55 billion cubic feet per year through 2024.  Our estimated total volume of production subject to these sales commitments is approximately 710 billion cubic feet of natural gas.  We also have multiple minimum delivery commitments in the Bakken for natural gas and NGL with various end dates up through 2032, with total commitments of approximately 100 million boe over the remaining life of the contracts.
We have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments, and we anticipate being able to meet future requirements from available proved and probable reserves, as well as projected third-party supply in the case of NGL.

Midstream
Prior to December 16, 2019, the Midstream segment was primarily comprised of Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP), a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), formed to own, operate, develop and acquire a diverse set of midstream assets to provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers.  HIP was initially formed on May 21, 2015, with Hess selling 50% of HIP to GIP for approximately $2.6 billion on July 1, 2015.
On April 10, 2017, HIP completed an initial public offering (IPO) of 16,997,000 common units, representing 30.5% limited partnership interests in its subsidiary Hess Midstream Partners LP (Hess Midstream Partners), for net proceeds of approximately $365.5 million.  In connection with the IPO, HIP contributed a 20% controlling economic interest in each of Hess North Dakota Pipeline Operations LP, Hess TGP Operations LP, and Hess North Dakota Export Logistics Operations LP, and a 100% economic interest in Hess Mentor Storage Holdings LLC (collectively the “Contributed Businesses”).  In exchange for the contributed businesses, Hess and GIP each received common and subordinated units representing a direct 33.75% limited partner interest in Hess Midstream Partners and a 50% indirect ownership interest through HIP in Hess Midstream Partners’ general partner, which had a 2% economic interest in Hess Midstream Partners plus incentive distribution rights.
On March 1, 2019, HIP acquired Hess’s existing Bakken water services business for $225 million in cash.  As a result of this transaction, we recorded an after-tax gain of $78 million in additional paid-in capital with an offsetting reduction to noncontrolling interest to reflect the adjustment to GIP’s noncontrolling interest in HIP.  On March 22, 2019, HIP and Hess Midstream Partners acquired crude oil and gas gathering assets, and HIP acquired water gathering assets of Summit Midstream Partners LP’s Tioga Gathering System for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $90 million, with the potential for up to an additional $10 million of contingent payments in future periods subject to certain future performance metrics.  On January 25, 2018, Hess Midstream Partners entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources Corp. to construct a new 200 million standard cubic feet per day gas processing plant call Little Missouri 4.  The plant, which is operated by Targa, was placed into service in the third quarter of 2019.
On December 16, 2019, Hess Midstream Partners acquired HIP, including HIP’s 80% interest in Hess Midstream Partners’ oil and gas midstream assets, HIP’s water services business and the outstanding economic general partner interest and incentive distribution rights in Hess Midstream Partners LP.  In addition, Hess Midstream Partners’ organizational structure converted from a master limited partnership into an “Up-C” structure in which Hess Midstream Partners’ public unitholders received newly issued Class A shares in a new public entity  named Hess Midstream LP (Hess Midstream), which is taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.  Hess Midstream Partners changed its name to “Hess Midstream Operations LP” (HESM Opco) and became a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream, the new publicly listed entity.  As consideration for the acquisition, Hess received a cash payment of $301 million and approximately 115 million newly issued HESM Opco Class B units.  After giving effect to the acquisition and related transactions, public shareholders of Class A shares in Hess Midstream own 6% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis and Hess and GIP each own 47% of the consolidated entity on an as-exchanged basis, primarily through the sponsors’ ownership of Class B units in HESM Opco that are exchangeable into Class A shares of Hess Midstream on a one-for-one basis, or referred to as “Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP”.
At December 31, 2020, Midstream assets included the following:
•Natural Gas Gathering and Compression: A natural gas gathering and compression system located primarily in McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota connecting Hess and third-party owned or operated wells to the Tioga Gas Plant, Little Missouri 4 Gas Plant, and third-party pipeline facilities.  This gathering system consists of approximately 1,350 miles of high and low pressure natural gas and NGL gathering pipelines with a current capacity of up to approximately 450 mmcfd, including an aggregate compression capacity of approximately 310 mmcfd.  In 2020, compression capacity was increased by approximately 70 mmcfd by expanding two existing compressor stations and restarting two additional legacy compression facilities. The system also includes the Hawkeye Gas Facility, which contributes approximately 50 mmcfd of the system’s current compression capacity.
•Crude Oil Gathering: A crude oil gathering system located primarily in McKenzie, Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota, connecting Hess and third-party owned or operated wells to the Ramberg Terminal Facility, the Tioga Rail Terminal
12

and the Johnson’s Corner Header System.  The crude oil gathering system consists of approximately 550 miles of crude oil gathering pipelines with a current capacity of up to approximately 240,000 bopd.  The system also includes the Hawkeye Oil Facility, which contributes approximately 75,000 bopd of the system’s current capacity.
•Tioga Gas Plant: A natural gas processing and fractionation plant located in Tioga, North Dakota, with a current processing capacity of approximately 250 mmcfd and fractionation capacity of approximately 60,000 boepd.  In 2019, Hess Midstream LP announced plans to expand processing capacity at the plant by 150 mmcfd for total processing capacity of 400 mmcfd.  In 2020, the facility construction was completed for the expansion. Incremental gas processing capacity is expected to be available in 2021 upon completion of a scheduled plant maintenance turnaround, during which the expansion and residue and NGL takeaway pipelines will be tied in. The plant maintenance turnaround was originally planned to occur in the third quarter of 2020 but was deferred to 2021 to ensure safe execution in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
•Little Missouri 4: A natural gas processing plant in McKenzie County, North Dakota, with processing capacity of approximately 200 mmcfd, which was placed in service during 2019 and is operated by Targa Resources Corp.  Hess Midstream LP owns a 50% interest in Little Missouri 4 through a joint venture with Targa Resources Corp. and is entitled to half of the plant’s processing capacity.
•Mentor Storage Terminal: A propane storage cavern and rail and truck loading and unloading facility located in Mentor, Minnesota, with approximately 330,000 boe of working storage capacity.
•Ramberg Terminal Facility: A crude oil pipeline and truck receipt terminal located in Williams County, North Dakota with a delivery capacity of up to approximately 285,000 bopd of crude oil into an interconnecting pipeline for transportation to the Tioga Rail Terminal and to multiple third-party pipelines and storage facilities.
•Tioga Rail Terminal: A 140,000 bopd crude oil and 30,000 boepd NGL rail loading terminal in Tioga, North Dakota that is connected to the Tioga Gas Plant, the Ramberg Terminal Facility and our crude oil gathering system.
•Crude Oil Rail Cars: A total of 550 crude oil rail cars, which are operated as unit trains consisting of approximately 100 to 110 crude oil rail cars.  These crude oil rail cars have been constructed to DOT-117 standards.
•Johnson’s Corner Header System: A crude oil pipeline header system located in McKenzie County, North Dakota that receives crude oil by pipeline from Hess and third parties and delivers crude oil to third-party interstate pipeline systems.  The facility has a delivery capacity of approximately 100,000 bopd of crude oil.
•Produced Water Gathering and Disposal: A produced water gathering system located primarily in Williams and Mountrail Counties, North Dakota, that transports produced water from the wellsite by approximately 270 miles of pipeline in gathering systems or by third-party trucking to water handling facilities for disposal.  As of December 31, 2020, five water handling and disposal facilities with a combined capacity of 70,000 barrels per day were in service. These water handling and disposal facilities are owned and operated by Hess Water Services Holdings LLC, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP. Produced water is also transported to twelve water handling and disposal facilities operated by third parties that have a combined permitted disposal capacity of approximately 170,000 barrels per day.
Hess Midstream has multiple long-term, fee-based commercial agreements effective January 1, 2014 with certain subsidiaries of Hess for gas gathering, crude oil gathering, gas processing and fractionation, storage services, and terminal and export services, each generally with an initial ten-year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. These contracts have minimum volumes that the Hess subsidiaries are obligated to provide each calendar quarter. The minimum volume commitments are subject to fluctuation based on nominations covering substantially all of our E&P segment’s production and projected third-party volumes that will be purchased in the Bakken. On December 30, 2020, Hess Midstream exercised its renewal options to extend the terms of certain gas gathering, crude oil gathering, gas processing and fractionation, storage, and terminal and export commercial agreements for the secondary term through December 31, 2033. There were no changes to any provisions of the existing commercial agreements as a result of the exercise of the renewal options. Hess Midstream also has long-term, fee based commercial agreements for water handling services effective January 1, 2019 with a subsidiary of Hess, with an initial 14 year term that can be extended for an additional ten-year term at the unilateral right of Hess Midstream. Water handling services are provided for an agreed-upon fee per barrel or the reimbursement of third-party fees.
Competition and Market Conditions
See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of competition and market conditions.
Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans and Procedures
We have in place a series of business and asset-specific emergency preparedness, response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities.  These plans are maintained,
13

reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability.  Where applicable, they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities.
Responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans.  Our contractors, service providers, representatives from government agencies and, where applicable, joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented.
To complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations, we maintain membership contracts with a network of local, regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations.  At the regional and global level, these organizations include CGA, MSRC, MWCC, WWC and OSRL.  CGA and MSRC are domestic spill response organizations and MWCC provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the Gulf of Mexico. WWC provides firefighting, well control and engineering services globally.  OSRL is a global response organization and is available, when needed, to assist us with any of our assets.  In addition to owning response assets in their own right, the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required.  OSRL’s response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges, more than 250 skimmers, over 600,000 feet of boom, nine capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment, including aircraft.  In addition to external well control and oil spill response support, we have contracts with wildlife, environmental, meteorology, incident management, medical and security resources.  If we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services, we would fund such services and, where appropriate, seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage, as described below.  In certain circumstances, we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support.  We maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the Executive Committees of CGA and MSRC, as well as the Board of Directors of OSRL.
We continue to participate in several industry-wide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents, access and control blowouts in subsea environments, and improve containment and recovery methods.  The task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention, preparedness, response and recovery processes.
Insurance Coverage and Indemnification
We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property, third-party liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, general liability, sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage.  This insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages.
The amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event, excluding Atlantic Named Windstorm coverage for which we are self-insured, varies by asset, based on the asset's estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss.  In the case of a catastrophic event, first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance.  The first $400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group.  Above this $400 million threshold, insurance is carried which ranges in value up to $1.27 billion in total, depending on the asset coverage level, as described above.  The insurance programs covering physical damage to our property exclude business interruption protection for our E&P operations.  Additionally, we carry insurance that provides third-party coverage for general liability, and sudden and accidental pollution, up to $850 million, which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest.  Our insurance policies renew at various dates each year.  Future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions, or additional exclusions or limitations.  In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable.
Generally, our drilling contracts (and most of our other offshore services contracts) provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract (the Corporation and Contractor) indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property (and, often, those of its contractors/subcontractors) regardless of fault.  Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party.  Third-party claims, on the other hand, are generally allocated on a fault basis.
We are customarily responsible for, and indemnify the Contractor against, all claims including those from third parties, to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property and the Contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the Contractor’s property.  Variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of a party.  Additionally, we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most third-party claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs, blowouts, cratering and loss of hole, regardless of cause, although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence and/or willful misconduct do exist.  Lastly, some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the Contractor’s liability equal to a fixed negotiated amount.  Variations may include exclusions of all contractual indemnities from the liability cap.
14

Under a standard JOA, each party is liable for all claims arising under the JOA, to the extent of its participating interest (operator or non-operator).  Variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence and/or willful misconduct of the operator, in which case the operator is solely liable.  The parties to the JOA may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions.  Further, under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties, liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several.
Government Regulations
The crude oil and natural gas industry is regulated at federal, state, local and foreign government levels. Regulations affecting elements of the energy sector are under continuous review for amendment or expansion over time, which may result in incremental costs of doing business and affect our profitability. See Regulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Compliance with various existing environmental, health and safety regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general and may reduce demand for our products. We spent approximately $15 million in 2020 for environmental remediation. The level of other expenditures to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses. For further discussion of environmental, health and safety regulations affecting our business, see Environment, Health and Safety in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

COVID-19 Response
We prioritize the safety of our workforce. Our safety programs and practices are designed to help ensure that everyone, everywhere gets home safe every day. Our response to COVID-19 reflects this commitment. A multidisciplinary Hess emergency response team has been overseeing plans and precautions to reduce the risks of COVID-19 in the work environment while maintaining business continuity based on the most current recommendations by government and public health agencies. The Corporation has implemented a variety of health and safety measures including enhanced cleaning procedures and modified work practices such as travel restrictions, health screenings, reduced personnel at offshore platforms and onshore work sites wherever this can be done safely, and remote working arrangements for office workers. We continue to adapt our work policies and benefits to prioritize emotional, mental and physical health and well-being. We are taking a deliberate and measured approach to returning to the physical work environment in each of our office locations.
During 2020, we adapted our Life at Hess initiative for a work experience that was largely away from the office and with stringent health and safety protocols throughout our operations, including:
•activated emergency response teams representing all Hess work locations to coordinate effective local deployment of our COVID-19 protocols;
15

•introduced policies reinforcing that COVID-19 will not negatively impact pay and benefits for employees who may miss work due to COVID-19 exposure, quarantine or test positive;
•provided work from home guidance, technology and training to allow office-based employees to complete their tasks effectively while working remotely;
•modified work schedules for field operations to lessen virus exposure and to accommodate quarantine protocols; and
•offered supplemental medical resources, such as at-home COVID-19 testing kits, mental wellness programs and access to third-party medical experts, at no cost to employees.

RAILWAY OPERATING REVENUES – Total railway operating revenues were $9.8 billion in 2020.  Following is an overview of our three commodity groups. See the discussion of merchandise revenues by major commodity group, intermodal revenues, and coal revenues and tonnage in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
MERCHANDISE – Our merchandise commodity group is composed of four groupings: 
•Agriculture, forest and consumer products includes soybeans, wheat, corn, fertilizer, livestock and poultry feed, food products, food oils, flour, sweeteners, ethanol, lumber and wood products, pulp board and paper products, wood fibers, wood pulp, scrap paper, beverages, canned goods, and consumer products.
•Chemicals includes sulfur and related chemicals, petroleum products (including crude oil), chlorine and bleaching compounds, plastics, rubber, industrial chemicals, chemical wastes and sand.
•Metals and construction includes steel, aluminum products, machinery, scrap metals, cement, aggregates, minerals, clay, transportation equipment, and items for the U.S. military.
•Automotive includes finished motor vehicles and automotive parts.

In 2020, we handled 2.1 million merchandise carloads, which accounted for 62% of our total railway operating revenues.

K5

INTERMODAL – Our intermodal commodity group consists of shipments moving in domestic and international containers and trailers.  These shipments are handled on behalf of intermodal marketing companies, international steamship lines, premium customers and asset owning companies. In 2020, we handled 4.0 million intermodal units, which accounted for 27% of our total railway operating revenues.
 
COAL – Coal revenues accounted for 11% of our total railway operating revenues in 2020.  We handled 64 million tons, or 0.6 million carloads, most of which originated on our lines from major eastern coal basins, with the balance from major western coal basins received via the Memphis and Chicago gateways.  Our coal franchise supports the electric generation market, serving approximately 50 coal-fired power plants, as well as the export, domestic metallurgical and industrial markets, primarily through direct rail and river, lake, and coastal facilities, including various terminals on the Ohio River, Lamberts Point in Norfolk, Virginia, the Port of Baltimore, and Lake Erie.

FREIGHT RATES – Our predominant pricing mechanisms, private contracts and exempt price quotes, are not subject to regulation. In general, market forces are the primary determinant of rail service prices.
 
RAILWAY PROPERTY
 
Our railroad infrastructure makes us capital intensive with net properties of approximately $31 billion on a historical cost basis.

Property Additions – Property additions for the past five years were as follows:

																													
 	2020		2019		2018		2017		2016
 	($ in millions)
									
Road and other property	$	1,046 			$	1,371 			$	1,276 			$	1,210 			$	1,292

Track Maintenance – Of the 35,500 total miles of track on which we operate, we are responsible for maintaining 28,800 miles, with the remainder being operated under trackage rights from other parties responsible for maintenance.
 
Over 84% of the main line trackage (including first, second, third, and branch main tracks, all excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights) has rail ranging from 131 to 155 pounds per yard with the standard installation currently at 136 pounds per yard.  Approximately 39% of our lines, excluding rail operated pursuant to trackage rights, carried 20 million or more gross tons per track mile during 2020.
 
The following table summarizes several measurements regarding our track roadway additions and replacements during the past five years:
																													
 	2020		2019		2018		2017		2016

Crossties installed (millions)	1.8 			2.4 			2.2 			2.5 			2.3 	

Traffic Control – Of the 16,400 route miles we dispatch, 11,300 miles are signalized, including 8,500 miles of centralized traffic control (CTC) and 2,800 miles of automatic block signals.  Of the 8,500 miles of CTC, 7,600 miles are controlled by data radio originating at 355 base station radio sites.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS – Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment is one of our principal goals.  To date, such compliance has not had a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or competitive position. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Workforce – We employed an average of 20,200 employees during 2020, and 19,100 employees at the end of 2020. Approximately 80% of our railroad employees – referred to as “craft” employees – are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. See the discussion of “Labor Agreements” in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  The remainder of our workforce is composed of management employees.
 
Craft Workforce Levels and Productivity – Maintaining appropriate headcount levels for our craft-employee workforce is critical to our on-time and consistent delivery of customers’ goods and operational efficiency goals. We manage this human capital metric through forecasting tools designed to ensure the optimal level of staffing to meet business demands while controlling costs. We measure and monitor employee productivity based on gross ton miles per train and engine employee.

Safety – We are dedicated to providing employees with a safe workplace and the knowledge and tools they need to work safely and return home safely every day. Our commitment to an injury-free workplace is illustrated by our “I am Coming Home” safety message, which is featured prominently in our yards, shops, and facilities and further reinforces the importance of working safely. We measure employee safety performance through internal metrics
K8

such as lost-time injuries and serious injuries per 200,000 employee-hours and metrics established by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), such as FRA reportable injuries per 200,000 employee-hours. Given the importance of safety among our workforce and business, in 2020, our Board of Directors established a standing Safety Committee that, among other duties, reviews, monitors, and evaluates our compliance with our safety programs and practices.

Attracting and Retaining Management Employees – Our talent strategy for management employees is essential to attracting strong candidates in a competitive talent environment. We evaluate the effectiveness of that strategy by studying market trends, benchmarking the attractiveness of our employee value proposition, and analyzing retention data.

We also focus on driving employee engagement, which is key to increasing employee productivity, retention, and safety. We take a data-centric approach, including the use of quarterly surveys among management employees, to identify new initiatives that will help boost engagement and drive business results.

Employee Development and Training – We provide a range of developmental programs, opportunities, skills, and resources for our employees to work safely and be successful in their careers. We provide hands-on training and simulation training designed to improve training effectiveness and safety outcomes.

We also use modern learning and performance technologies to offer robust professional growth opportunities. Through on-demand digital course offerings, custom-built learning paths, and performance-management tools, our platforms deliver a contemporary, convenient, and inclusive approach to professional development.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion – As a leading transportation service company, we understand that competing in the global marketplace requires recruiting the most qualified, talented, and diverse people. We strive to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace where a wide range of perspectives and experiences are represented, valued, and empowered to thrive.

While our current workforce reflects a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, we continue to focus on building an even more diverse workforce, using technology-driven outreach and multiple recruiting relationships to maintain a robust pipeline of diverse talent.

To underscore our commitment to cultivating a workplace experience where the unique experiences, perspectives, and contributions of all our people are valued, our senior management team recently signed a pledge reaffirming our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. To advance that commitment, senior leaders from across the company serve on an Inclusion Leadership Council, which is accountable for setting our enterprise inclusion strategy and articulating measurable goals and actions needed to achieve them.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION – In addition to environmental, safety, securities, and other regulations generally applicable to all business, our railroads are subject to regulation by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB).  The STB has jurisdiction to varying extents over rates, routes, customer access provisions, fuel surcharges, conditions of service, and the extension or abandonment of rail lines.  The STB has jurisdiction to determine whether we are “revenue adequate” on an annual basis based on the results of the prior year. A railroad is “revenue adequate” on an annual basis under the applicable law when its return on net investment exceeds the rail industry’s composite cost of capital.  This determination is made pursuant to a statutory requirement. The STB also has jurisdiction over the consolidation, merger, or acquisition of control of and by rail common carriers. 
 
The relaxation of economic regulation of railroads, following the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, included exemption from STB regulation of the rates and most service terms for intermodal business (trailer-on-flat-car, container-on-flat-car), rail boxcar shipments, lumber, manufactured steel, automobiles, and certain bulk commodities such as sand, gravel, pulpwood, and wood chips for paper manufacturing.  Further, all shipments that we have under contract are effectively removed from commercial regulation for the duration of the contract.  Approximately 90% of our revenues comes from either exempt shipments or shipments moving under transportation contracts; the remainder comes from shipments moving under public tariff rates.
 
K9

Efforts have been made over the past several years to increase federal economic regulation of the rail industry, and such efforts are expected to continue in 2021.  The Staggers Rail Act of 1980 substantially balanced the interests of shippers and rail carriers, and encouraged and enabled rail carriers to innovate, invest in their infrastructure, and compete for business, thereby contributing to the economic health of the nation and to the revitalization of the industry.  Accordingly, we will continue to oppose efforts to reimpose increased economic regulation. 
 
Government regulations are further discussed within Item 1A “Risk Factors” and the safety and security of our railroads are discussed within the “Security of Operations” section contained herein.
 
COMPETITION – There is continuing strong competition among rail, water, and highway carriers.  Price is usually only one factor of importance as shippers and receivers choose a transport mode and specific hauling company. Inventory carrying costs, service reliability, ease of handling, and the desire to avoid loss and damage during transit are also important considerations, especially for higher-valued finished goods, machinery, and consumer products.  Even for raw materials, semi-finished goods, and work-in-progress, users are increasingly sensitive to transport arrangements that minimize problems at successive production stages.

Our primary rail competitor is CSX Corporation (CSX); both we and CSX operate throughout much of the same territory. Other railroads also operate in parts of the territory.  We also compete with motor carriers, water carriers, and with shippers who have the additional options of handling their own goods in private carriage, sourcing products from different geographic areas, and using substitute products.
 
Certain marketing strategies to expand reach and shipping options among railroads and between railroads and motor carriers enable railroads to compete more effectively in specific markets. 

SECURITY OF OPERATIONS – We continue to enhance the security of our rail system. Our comprehensive security plan is modeled on and was developed in conjunction with the security plan prepared by the Association of American Railroads (AAR) post September 11, 2001. The AAR Security Plan defines four Alert Levels and details the actions and countermeasures that are being applied across the railroad industry to mitigate the risk of terrorist, violent extremist or seriously disruptive cyber-attack increases or decreases. The Alert Level actions include countermeasures that will be applied in three general areas: (1) operations (including transportation, engineering, and mechanical); (2) information technology and communications; and, (3) railroad police. All of our Operations Division employees are advised by their supervisors or train dispatchers, as appropriate, of any change in Alert Level and any additional responsibilities they may incur due to such change.

Our security plan also complies with U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) security regulations pertaining to training and security plans with respect to the transportation of hazardous materials. As part of the plan, security awareness training is given to all railroad employees who directly affect hazardous material transportation safety, and is integrated into hazardous material training programs. Additionally, location-specific security plans are in place for rail corridors in certain metropolitan areas referred to as High Threat Urban Areas (HTUA). Particular attention is aimed at reducing risk in a HTUA by: (1) the establishment of secure storage areas for rail cars carrying toxic-by-inhalation (TIH) materials; (2) the expedited movement of trains transporting rail cars carrying TIH materials; (3) reducing the number of unattended loaded tank cars carrying TIH materials; and (4) cooperation with federal, state, local, and tribal governments to identify those locations where security risks are the highest.

We also operate six facilities that are under U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Maritime Security Regulations. With respect to these facilities, each facility’s security plan has been approved by the applicable Captain of the Port and remains subject to inspection by the USCG.

Additionally, we continue to engage in close and regular coordination with numerous federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FRA, the USCG, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Defense, and various state Homeland Security offices.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to cancellation of all face-to-face training, including the Safety Train Tour as part of our Operation Awareness and Response Program, as well as participation in the Transportation Community
K10

Awareness and Emergency Response Program. The need to provide training to first responders did not go away. Our Hazmat Group adapted and created online training courses as well as conducted training webinars for first responders. Even with the adverse conditions of 2020, we provided rail accident response training to approximately 1,000 emergency responders, such as local police and fire personnel.

We also continually evaluate ourselves for appropriate business continuity and disaster recovery planning, with test scenarios that include cybersecurity attacks. Our risk-based information security program helps ensure our defenses and resources are aligned to address the most likely and most damaging potential attacks, to provide support for our organizational mission and operational objectives, and to keep us in the best position to detect, mitigate, and recover from a wide variety of potential attacks in a timely fashion.

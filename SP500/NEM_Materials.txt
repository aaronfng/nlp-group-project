Introduction
Newmont Corporation is primarily a gold producer with significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. At December 31, 2020, Newmont had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 94.2 million ounces and an aggregate land position of approximately 22,700 square miles (58,900 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged in the production of copper, silver, lead and zinc. Newmont Corporation was incorporated in 1921 and is completing its 100th year as the world’s leading gold company.
Newmont’s corporate headquarters are in Denver, Colorado, USA. In this report, “Newmont,” the “Company,” “our” and “we” refer to Newmont Corporation together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.
On April 18, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Goldcorp, Inc. (“Goldcorp”) (“the Newmont Goldcorp transaction”). Results of Goldcorp for the period April 18 to December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2020 are included in this report. For further information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On July 1, 2019, we completed the formation of Nevada Gold Mines (“NGM”), in which we hold a 38.5% interest. As part of the formation of NGM, we contributed Carlin, Phoenix, Twin Creeks and Long Canyon (“existing Nevada mining operations”) in exchange for our 38.5% interest. Historically, our Phoenix operations in the United States produced copper as a co-product up until the formation of NGM, effective July 1, 2019 (the “effective date”), at which point copper became a by-product. Results of our existing Nevada mining operations for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018 are included in this report. NGM is included for the period July 1 to December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2020, which is presented at our 38.5% proportionate share, unless otherwise indicated. For further information, see Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Segment Information
Our operations are organized in five geographic regions; North America, South America, Australia, Africa and Nevada. Our North America segment consists primarily of Cripple Creek & Victor (“CC&V”) in the United States of America (“U.S.” or “USA”), Musselwhite, Porcupine and Éléonore in Canada and Peñasquito in Mexico. Our South America segment consists primarily of Yanacocha in Peru, Merian in Suriname, Cerro Negro in Argentina and our 40% equity interest in the Pueblo Viejo mine. Our Australia segment consists primarily of Boddington and Tanami in Australia. Our Africa segment consists primarily of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana. Our Nevada segment consists of NGM.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, our Nevada segment included Carlin, Phoenix, Twin Creeks and Long Canyon in the USA, which were contributed to NGM on July 1, 2019. See Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
At December 31, 2019, our Red Lake mine in our North America segment and Kalgoorlie mine in our Australia segment were held for sale and subsequently were sold in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our assets held for sale.
See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to our reportable segments. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to domestic and export sales and lack of dependence on a limited number of customers.
Products
References in this report to “attributable” means that portion of gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves and mineralized material based on our proportionate ownership, unless otherwise noted.
Gold
General. We had consolidated gold production from continuing operations of 5.8 million ounces (5.5 million attributable gold ounces) in 2020, 6.4 million ounces (6.0 million attributable gold ounces) in 2019 and 5.5 million ounces (5.1 million attributable gold ounces) in 2018. Of our 2020 consolidated gold production, approximately 25% came from North America, 17% from South America, 20% from Australia, 15% from Africa and 23% from Nevada.
For 2020, 2019 and 2018, 90%, 93% and 96%, respectively, of our Sales were attributable to gold. Most of our Sales come from the sale of refined gold. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to our account or delivered to buyers. A portion of gold sold from Peñasquito in North America, Boddington in Australia and NGM and Phoenix (until the formation of NGM) in Nevada is sold in a concentrate containing other metals such as copper, silver, lead and/or zinc.

Gold Uses. Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.
Gold Supply. A combination of mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information available, for the years 2018 through 2020, mine production has averaged approximately 70% of the annual gold supply.

Other Co-product Metals
Generally, if a metal expected to be mined represents more than 10 to 20% of the life of mine sales value of all the metal expected to be mined, the metal is considered a co-product and recognized as Sales in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In 2020, copper production at Boddington and silver, lead and zinc production at Peñasquito are considered co-products. In 2019, copper production at Boddington and Phoenix (until the formation of NGM) and silver, lead and zinc production at Peñasquito were considered co-products. In 2018, copper production at Boddington and Phoenix were considered co-products. Copper, silver, lead and zinc sales are generally in the form of concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining.
Copper. We had consolidated co-product copper production of 56 million pounds in 2020, 79 million pounds in 2019 and 109 million pounds in 2018. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, 1%, 2% and 4%, respectively, of Sales were attributable to copper. All of our 2020 copper production came from Australia.
Silver. We had consolidated co-product silver production of 27.8 million ounces in 2020 and 15.9 million ounces in 2019. For 2020 and 2019, 5% and 3%, respectively, of Sales were attributable to silver. All of our 2020 silver production came from North America.
Lead. We had consolidated co-product lead production of 179 million pounds in 2020 and 108 million pounds in 2019. For 2020 and 2019, 1% and 1%, respectively, of Sales were attributable to lead. All of our 2020 lead production came from North America.
Zinc. We had consolidated co-product zinc production of 381 million pounds in 2020 and 187 million pounds in 2019. For 2020 and 2019, 3% and 1%, respectively, of Sales were attributable to zinc. All of our 2020 zinc production came from North America.
Gold and Other Metals Processing Methods
Doré. Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable, synthetically lined pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold contained within the ore. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.
Gold contained in ores that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either

roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.
Some gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold.
Concentrate. At Peñasquito, sulfide ore is delivered to a crushing and grinding plant which feeds a sulfide processing plant. The sulfide processing plant primarily comprises lead and zinc flotation stages. In the lead and zinc flotation, the slurry is conditioned with reagents to activate the desired minerals and produce lead and zinc concentrate. The lead concentrate is highly enriched in gold and silver, with a smaller fraction of the precious metal reporting to zinc concentrate. The resulting concentrate is sold to smelters or traders for further processing.
At Boddington and Phoenix (until the formation of NGM), ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation resulting in a copper/gold concentrate containing approximately 15% to 20% copper. The flotation tailings have a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit.
Competition
The top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately thirty percent of total worldwide mined gold production. We currently rank as the top gold producer with approximately six percent of estimated total worldwide mined gold production. Our competitive position is based on the size and grade of our ore bodies anchored in favorable mining jurisdictions and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers. We have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce, and to manage our costs.
Licenses and Concessions
Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contracts with, the host government. These countries include, among others, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Australia and Ghana. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with the host country. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information.
Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance
Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. See “Results of Consolidated Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" within Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, for further information.
We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information.
Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG")
Our sustainability strategy is a foundational element in achieving our purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Sustainability and safety are integrated into the business at all levels of the organization through our global policies, standards, strategies, business plans and remuneration plans.
Mitigating and managing the inherent risks in our business is critical to our success and aligned with our stakeholders’ interests. We are committed to the responsible management of resources such as land, air quality, water and biodiversity, as well as putting the health and safety of our people first. Newmont's policies and standards support these efforts and guide our performance. In addition, we voluntarily participate in organizations and initiatives that provide a framework for action, a means for independently measuring and assuring our performance and a forum to learn and share best practices. We continue to develop complementary programs to guide our Company toward achieving environmental and social performance objectives in a transparent manner.
Our systems ensure effective health, safety, social responsibility and environmental performance is maintained at all of Newmont operations. Our Global Standards define the minimum expectations at all levels of the business and conformance is formally verified on a regular basis. Additionally, since 2007 we have assessed our environmental management systems against International Standards Organization ("ISO") 14001:2016 stipulations.

Our Combined Voluntary Commitments Assessment program, piloted in 2020, is designed to efficiently manage Newmont’s voluntary sustainability framework commitments, including asset and corporate level assurance and verification activities required for International Council on Mining and Metal’s ("ICMM") Performance Expectations, World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles and, where applicable, Towards Sustainable Mining. Performance against these sustainability frameworks will be publicly reported.
In 2020, we launched an integrated, global Compliance Audit program, which includes assessment of environment and social obligations such as those dictated in regulations, permits, community agreements and similar. Audits are completed at all Newmont's operations on a regular cadence by an independent, third-party audit team, and resulting actions are tracked to completion.
We accept the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s ("IPCC") assessment of climate science and acknowledge that human activities contribute to climate change and business has an important role in addressing this global challenge. We follow The Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD") guidelines to disclose climate-related governance, strategy, risk and metrics and targets designed to align with the Paris Agreement outcomes and the long-term goal to limit average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Newmont has participated in annual CDP (formerly "Carbon Disclosure Project") disclosures since 2004, and our greenhouse gas emissions are independently verified following the ISO 14064-3:2006 guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas statements. In November 2020, we committed to industry leading climate targets of 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, with an ultimate goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. As part of this commitment, we will be investing $500 million in climate change initiatives over the next five years, from 2021 through 2025.
We actively participate in the ICMM and are committed to the ICMM’s Mining Principles and its commitment to implement the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact on human rights, bribery and corruption, labor and the environment. Our compliance to the Mining Principles and any mandatory requirements set out in ICMM Position Statements is externally assured in line with the ICMM Sustainable Development Framework: Assurance Procedure.

We are the only gold producer listed in the S&P 500 Index and are widely recognized for our principled ESG practices. As the second-most transparent reporter in the S&P 500 (as measured by the Bloomberg ESG Disclosure score), we annually report on our sustainability performance in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") Standards Core option, the GRI Mining and Metals Sector Supplement and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") guidelines for the Extractives and Minerals Processing Sector (version 2018-10). Newmont was ranked the top miner in June 2020 in 3BL Media’s 100 Best Corporate Citizens list which ranks the 1,000 largest publicly traded U.S. companies on ESG transparency and performance. Additionally, in 2020, for the sixth year in a row, Newmont was ranked as the mining and metal sector’s top gold miner by the SAM S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment, and we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (“DJSI World”) since 2007.
Environmental Matters
Our operations span four continents in a range of ecosystems that include tropical, desert and arctic climates. We understand the impact our activities can have on the environment and are committed to protect and prevent – or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate – those impacts in the areas where we operate.
Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. For a discussion of related risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.
We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Each operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets, in all material respects, applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites.
For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, see Note 6 and Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Newmont's People
At Newmont, one of the strategic pillars is people, which forms the basis of our business planning and establishes objectives by which we measure our performance. The success of our business comes from the accomplishments and well-being of our employees and contractors. Our goal is to build a workplace culture that fosters leaders and allows every person to thrive, contribute, and grow.
Approximately 14,300 people were employed by Newmont and Newmont subsidiaries and approximately 13,500 people were working as contractors in support of Newmont’s operations at December 31, 2020. Additionally, at December 31, 2020, 39% of our workforce were members of a union or participate in a collective bargaining agreement. We are committed to fostering solid relationships with all members of our workforce based on trust, treating workers fairly and providing them with safe and healthy working conditions. For a discussion of related risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Inclusion and Diversity
The people who work on our behalf give us a competitive advantage. Through our global human capital strategy, we align our talent management efforts with the overall business strategy. The strategy’s focus areas include enhancing the employee experience and evolving for future workforce needs; building our bench strength and leadership capabilities; developing effective labor relations that align stakeholders with a shared future; and improving inclusion, including reaching gender parity. We believe that progressing an inclusive workplace culture is a critical part of tackling the challenge of attracting and retaining diverse employees.
Setting the tone at the top, the Company’s Board has been recognized as a leader in Board diversity and inclusive leadership. Our Board values diversity across a number of categories, including diversity of gender, race, ethnicity and nationality, as well as professional backgrounds, in order to insure that the mix of perspectives, expertise and skills necessary to oversee execution of the Company's strategy are present in our boardroom. During 2020, the Newmont Board achieved gender parity amongst independent Directors, with 50 percent female representation, and 70 percent of our independent Directors falling within either gender or ethnically diverse categories as of December 31, 2020. The diverse nature of our directors, with experiences across various industries and operating regions, enhance oversight of our global organization and strategy.
In 2020, we were also active participants in the Paradigm for Parity framework, a coalition of business leaders committed to a workplace where women and men have equal power, status and opportunity in senior leadership by 2030, and we are committed to advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goal to achieve gender equality. In our annual sustainability report, Newmont voluntarily reports workforce and labor information in accordance with GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards, including data on workforce demographics, compensation and equal remuneration, gender diversity, union representation, labor relations, employee turnover, hiring representation, and training and development.
Emphasis on health, safety and sustainability
The importance of ESG performance is emphasized with our workforce through our training and development programs and our compensation design. Employees eligible for our short-term incentive plan are held accountable for the Company’s health, safety and sustainability performance through Newmont’s performance based compensation structure. ESG will comprise 30% of the Company’s Short-term Incentive Plan payout for 2020, with 20% allocated to health & safety metrics and 10% to sustainability performance based upon key public indices. In 2020, Newmont generated strong results in our health and safety and our sustainability measures with all sites and regions having performed above target for their critical control verifications to support fatality risk management, and significant progress on fatigue and wellbeing risk reduction plans. Additional information regarding the Company’s compensation programs and performance will be provided in the 2020 Proxy Statement, expected to be filed with the SEC on or about March 12, 2021.
For a discussion of related risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Health and Safety
We believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We continue to sustain robust controls at our operations and offices around the globe, including heightened levels of health screening and testing, in connection with COVID-19, to protect both our workforce and the local communities in which we operate. In addition, the Company has an established Health & Safety Management System and Health, Safety and Security Standards that in most cases exceed regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The quality of our Health & Safety Management System is audited regularly as part of our assurance and governance process.
The safety of our people and the communities in which we operate is a priority core value; with the right to life and right to safe working conditions among our most salient human rights and key priorities. We strongly believe it is possible to effectively manage these risks, ensuring that everyone returns home safely at the end of the day. To drive a fatality, injury and illness free culture, Newmont has centered its health, safety and security activities on four key focus areas: leadership; fatality prevention; occupational health and wellness; and security threat management.
In 2020 we transformed our fatality risk management program resulting in over 70,000 in-field critical control verifications being undertaken, and a large proportion via our new mobile application. These verifications were undertaken by various levels of leadership who increased their visible field presence. A shift in focus to engineering controls and technology resulted in new Vehicles and Driving standards which includes minimum vehicle specifications. Similarly, the focus on eliminating "live work" has resulted in innovative redesigning of tasks to eliminate our teams exposure to this critical risk.
COVID-19 Impact
The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. COVID-19 has since spread worldwide, posing public health risks across the globe and has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and workforce participation and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic we fully mobilized our business continuity plans and rapid response crisis management teams and worked closely with host

and indigenous communities, regional and national governments and medical experts to protect our workforce and nearby communities, while also taking steps to preserve the long-term value of our business.
As a global business, we are committed to doing our part to combat this disease and protect people and their livelihoods. Newmont engaged its Rapid Response process early in connection with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and proactively took conservative steps to prevent further transmission in 2020. These include, but are not limited to:
•Strict social distancing protocols and suspension of large indoor gatherings;
•Flexible and remote working plans for employees;
•Enhancing temperature and questionnaire screening at entry to sites;
•Screening stations established both pre-travel and on-entry incorporating the use of antibody and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for sites in high risk locations;
•Increased inventory of hand sanitizer, soap and hygiene supplies;
•Providing logistical and healthcare support to nearby communities where needed;
•Restricting all non-essential travel;
•Restricting entrance to sites to business-critical visits, essential deliveries and critical contract workers;
•Implementing strict physical distancing protocols in planes, buses, light vehicles, offices and dining facilities;
•Increased frequency of deep cleaning and sanitization of surfaces; and
•Mandatory self-quarantine for anyone who has traveled internationally, has flu-like symptoms or who has had direct contact with any person known to have COVID-19.
Additionally, in April 2020, we established the Newmont Global Community Support Fund, a $20 fund to help host communities, governments and employees combat the COVID-19 pandemic, of which approximately $11 has been distributed through December 31, 2020. The fund is designed to focus on employee and community health, food security and local economic resilience through partnerships with local governments, medical institutions, charities and non-governmental organizations to address the greatest needs with long-term resiliency and future community development in mind.

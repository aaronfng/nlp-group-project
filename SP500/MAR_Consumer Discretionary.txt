Corporate Structure and Business
We are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotel, residential, and timeshare properties under numerous brand names at different price and service points. Consistent with our focus on management, franchising, and licensing, we own very few of our lodging properties.

The following table shows our portfolio of brands at year-end 2020.

We discuss our operations in the following three reportable business segments: United States and Canada (“U.S. & Canada”), Asia Pacific, and Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”). Our Caribbean and Latin America (“CALA”) operating segment does not meet the applicable accounting criteria for separate disclosure as a reportable business segment, and we include its results in “Unallocated corporate and other.” In the 2020 fourth quarter, we changed the name of our largest segment from “North America” to “U.S. & Canada.” Other than the name change, we made no other changes to the composition of this segment. In January 2021, we modified our reportable segment structure as a result of a change in the way management intends to evaluate results and allocate resources within the Company. Beginning with the 2021 first quarter, we will report the following two operating segments: U.S. & Canada and International. See Note 15 for more information.
COVID-19
COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on the travel industry and the Company. As the virus and efforts to contain it spread around the world, demand at our hotels dropped significantly. While 2020 generally got off to a great start, we saw sudden, sharp declines in hotel occupancy, beginning in Greater China in January 2020 and then extending around the world. In April 2020, comparable systemwide constant dollar RevPAR experienced a record decline, decreasing 90 percent worldwide compared to the prior year period, and 27 percent of our hotels were temporarily closed. Although business at our hotels improved throughout the remainder of 2020 as compared to the extremely low levels in April 2020, COVID-19 continues to constrain recovery and to have a significant negative impact on demand. COVID-19 also resulted in significantly lower new room additions than we had budgeted for 2020 and historically high levels of cancellations by group and other travelers for future periods. As a result, our revenues and profitability declined dramatically in 2020 compared to 2019.
We continue to take substantial measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts of COVID-19 for our hotel owners and our own business, and we remain focused on taking care of our guests and associates. We have made significant changes to our business and enhanced our liquidity position, while remaining focused on how to best position ourselves for recovery and for growth over the longer term. At the property level, we implemented plans to help our hotel owners and franchisees reduce their cash outlays and mitigate costs, and we implemented a multi-pronged platform to elevate cleanliness standards and hospitality norms for the health and safety of our guests and associates. At the corporate level, we made significant cuts in general and administrative costs and spending on capital and other investments. We have substantially completed our above-property restructuring program, and we have implemented and are continuing to develop restructuring plans to achieve cost savings specific to each of our company-operated properties. With the steps we have taken, and any additional measures we may take to adapt our operations and plans to the evolving situation, along with the power of our Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program, our strengthened liquidity position, and our incredible team of associates around the world, we believe that our business is well positioned now and for the future.
For further information about COVID-19’s impact to our business, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide
On September 23, 2016 (the “Merger Date”), we completed the acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, LLC, formerly known as Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. (“Starwood”), through a series of transactions (the “Starwood Combination”), after which Starwood became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. We refer to the Starwood business and brands that we acquired as “Legacy-Starwood.”

Company-Operated Properties
At year-end 2020, we had 2,149 company-operated properties (585,132 rooms), which included properties under long-term management or lease agreements with property owners (management and lease agreements together, the “Operating Agreements”), properties that we own, and home and condominium communities for which we manage the related owners’ associations.
Terms of our management agreements vary, but we earn a management fee that is typically composed of a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically include reimbursement of costs of operations (both direct and indirect). Such agreements are generally for initial periods of 15 to 30 years, with options for us to renew for up to 10 or more additional years. Our lease agreements also vary, but may include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a specified percentage of annual revenues that exceed a fixed amount. Many of our Operating Agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners. Many of our Operating Agreements also permit the owners to terminate the agreement if we do not meet certain performance metrics, financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time, and we have not cured those deficiencies. In certain circumstances, some of our management agreements allow owners to convert company-operated properties to franchised properties under our brands.
For the lodging facilities we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the managers and employees needed to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies, and owners are required to reimburse us for those costs. We provide centralized reservation services and advertising, marketing, and promotional services, as well as various accounting and data processing services, and owners are also required to reimburse us for those costs.
Franchised and Licensed Properties
We have franchising and licensing arrangements that permit hotel owners and operators to use many of our lodging brand names and systems. Under our hotel franchising arrangements, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees, which typically range from four to seven percent of room revenues for all brands, plus two to three percent of food and beverage revenues for certain full-service brands. Franchisees contribute to our marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems.
We also receive royalty fees under license agreements with Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation (“MVW”), our former timeshare subsidiary that we spun off in 2011, and its affiliates for certain brands, including Marriott Vacation Club, Grand Residences by Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton Destination Club, Westin, Sheraton, and for certain existing properties, St. Regis and The Luxury Collection. We receive license fees from MVW consisting of a fixed annual fee, adjusted for inflation, plus certain variable fees based on sales volumes.
At year-end 2020, we had 5,493 franchised and licensed properties (837,912 rooms).
Residential
We use or license our trademarks for the sale of residential real estate, often in conjunction with hotel development, and receive branding fees for sales of such branded residential real estate by others. Third-party owners typically construct and sell residences with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. We have used or licensed the JW Marriott, The Ritz-Carlton, Ritz-Carlton Reserve, W, The Luxury Collection, St. Regis, EDITION, Bulgari, Renaissance, Le Méridien, Marriott, Sheraton, Westin, Four Points, Delta and Autograph Collection brand names and trademarks for residential real estate sales.
Intellectual Property
We operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos are very important to the sales and marketing of our properties and services. We believe that our brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality, care, service, and value to our customers, guests, and the traveling public. Accordingly, we register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise protect against its unauthorized use.
Brand Portfolio
We believe that our brand portfolio offers the most compelling range of brands and hotels in hospitality. Our brands are categorized by style of offering - Classic and Distinctive. Our Classic brands offer time-honored hospitality for the modern traveler, and our Distinctive brands offer memorable experiences with a unique perspective - each of which we group into three quality tiers: Luxury, Premium, and Select.

Loyalty and Credit Card Programs
Marriott BonvoyTM is our customer loyalty program through which members have access to our diverse brand portfolio, rich benefits, and travel experiences. We refer to Marriott Bonvoy throughout this report as our “Loyalty Program.”
Our Loyalty Program rewards members with points toward free hotel stays, access to travel experiences through our Marriott Bonvoy Tours & Activities program, miles with participating airline programs, and other benefits. We believe that our Loyalty Program generates substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. In each of 2019 and 2020, approximately 50 percent of our room nights were booked by Loyalty Program members. We strategically market to this large and growing guest base to generate revenue. See the “Loyalty Program” caption in Note 2 for more information.
We have multi-year agreements with JPMorgan Chase and American Express for our U.S.-issued, co-brand credit cards associated with our Loyalty Program. We also license credit card programs internationally, including in Canada, the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates, and Japan. We earn fixed amounts that are generally payable at contract inception and variable amounts that are paid to us monthly over the term of the agreements primarily based on card usage, and we believe that our co-brand credit cards contribute to the success of our Loyalty Program and reflect the quality and value of our portfolio of brands. In 2020, we signed amendments to the existing agreements for our U.S.-issued co-brand credit cards associated with our Loyalty Program. These amendments provided the Company with $920 million of cash from the prepayment of certain future revenues, the early payment of a previously committed signing bonus, and the pre-purchase of Marriott Bonvoy points and other consideration.
Sales and Marketing and Reservation Systems
Marriott.com, our international websites, and our mobile application allow for a seamless booking experience and easy enrollment in our Loyalty Program to book our exclusive Member Rates and participate in program benefits. The Company responded quickly and flexibly during the COVID-19 crisis to meet the needs of our guests by launching new programs, such as Work Anywhere with Marriott Bonvoy, as well as new Marriott web content, focused on providing current hotel and travel information regarding COVID-19. Our Look No Further® Best Rate Guarantee ensures best rate integrity, strengthening consumer confidence in our brand and giving guests access to the best rates when they book hotel rooms through our direct channels. We also remain focused on growing engagement levels with millions of guests by interacting with them through a
8
Table of Contents                                        
variety of channels, including our mobile application and digital guest services – contactless check-in and check-out, chat, service requests, mobile key, and more - across our hotel portfolio. Our digital strategy continues to focus on driving bookings to our direct channels, which generally deliver more profitable business to hotels in our system compared to bookings made through intermediary channels. Through our direct channels, we aim to create a simple and efficient digital shopping and booking experience, while elevating our service through digitally-enabled guest services to generate superior guest satisfaction and enable more frictionless and memorable stays at our properties.
At year-end 2020, we operated 20 hotel reservation centers, seven in the U.S. and 13 in other countries and territories, which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide, including franchised properties. We own two of the U.S. facilities and either lease the others or share space with a company-operated property. Our reservation system manages inventory and allows us to utilize third-party agents where cost effective. Economies of scale enable us to minimize costs per occupied room.
We believe our global sales and revenue management organizations are a key competitive advantage due to our unrelenting focus on optimizing our investment in people, processes, and systems. Our above-property sales deployment strategy aligns our sales efforts around how the customer wants to buy, reducing duplication of efforts by individual hotels and allowing us to cover a larger number of accounts. We also utilize innovative and sophisticated revenue management systems, many of which are proprietary, which we believe provide a competitive advantage in pricing decisions, increasing efficiency and optimizing property-level revenue for hotels in our portfolio. Most of the hotels in our portfolio utilize web-based programs to effectively manage the rate set-up and modification processes which provides for greater pricing flexibility, reduces time spent on rate program creation and maintenance, and increases the speed to market of new products and services.
Competition
We encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor. Other lodging management companies are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national and international chains that own and operate their own hotels, operate hotels on behalf of third-party owners, and also franchise their brands. Management contracts are typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if it does not meet certain financial or performance criteria.
Our direct digital channels also compete for guests with large companies that offer online travel services as part of their business model such as Expedia.com, Priceline.com, Booking.com, Travelocity.com, and Orbitz.com and search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Baidu. Our hotels compete for guests with other hotels and online platforms, including Airbnb and Vrbo, that allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments as an alternative to hotel rooms. We compete for guests in many areas, including brand recognition and reputation, location, guest satisfaction, room rates, quality of service, amenities, quality of accommodations, safety and security, and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points.
Affiliation with a brand is common in the U.S. lodging industry, and we believe that our brand recognition assists us in attracting and retaining guests, owners, and franchisees. In 2020, approximately 72 percent of U.S. hotel rooms were brand-affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the owner pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. In the franchising business, we face many competitors that have strong brands and guest appeal, including Hilton, Intercontinental Hotels Group, Hyatt, Wyndham, Accor, Choice, Radisson, Best Western, and others.
Outside the U.S., branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators, although branding is more common for new hotel development. We believe that chain affiliation will become more attractive in many overseas markets as local economies grow, trade barriers decline, international travel accelerates, and hotel owners seek the benefits of centralized reservation systems, marketing programs, and our Loyalty Program.
Based on lodging industry data, we have an approximately 16 percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms) and we estimate less than a four percent share of the hotel market outside the U.S. We believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher RevPAR than our direct competitors in most market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong guest preference. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities, our marketing programs, our reservation systems, our Loyalty Program, and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction contribute to guest preference across all our brands.
Seasonality
In general, business at company-operated and franchised properties fluctuates moderately with the seasons. Business at some resort properties may be more seasonal depending on location.

Human Capital Management
Marriott’s long history of service, innovation and growth was built on a commitment to take care of people. Today, that commitment is known as TakeCare. Through our TakeCare commitment, we are dedicated to providing opportunity, community, and purpose for all associates.
At year-end 2020, Marriott employed approximately 121,000 associates at properties, customer care centers, and above-property operations. Approximately 98,000 of these associates are located in the U.S., of which approximately 20,000 belong to labor unions. Outside the U.S., some of our associates are represented by trade unions, works councils, or employee associations. These numbers do not include associates employed by our hotel owners (which is common outside the U.S.) or hotel personnel employed by our franchisees or other management companies hired by our franchisees. Marriott manages over 200,000 associates who are employed by hotel owners.
As a result of COVID-19’s impact on our industry and the significant decline in demand for hotel rooms, we had to take substantial measures to mitigate the negative financial and operational impacts for our hotel owners and our business. These measures included furloughing a substantial number of our associates and implementing reduced work weeks for other associates. These furlough and reduced work week arrangements have ended at our above-property locations, but continue for a significant number of our on-property associates. In addition, to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency, we implemented restructuring plans impacting both on-property and above-property associates, which included a voluntary transition program for certain associates and the elimination of a significant number of positions. Our property-level restructuring plans are ongoing. As a result of COVID-19 and the uncertainty regarding when lodging demand and RevPAR levels will recover, the size of our global workforce remains in transition.
During this period of disruption for our industry, we continue to be focused on the needs of our associates. We made a temporary policy change to offer Company-subsidized health care coverage for eligible U.S. associates on furlough and to reduce the required hours worked to allow eligible U.S. associates to continue to qualify for Company-subsidized health care coverage. Additionally, we implemented new policies and protocols designed to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 at our hotels and protect our on-property associates, such as requiring all associates to wear face coverings in indoor public areas, enhancing our already rigorous cleaning procedures, and maintaining social distancing protocols.
We have a comprehensive compensation and benefits program designed to reward our associates and enrich their well-being. Our policies and practices are designed to avoid pay inequities throughout an associate’s career. In the U.S., salary history inquiries are prohibited during our hiring process and pay equity audits are conducted periodically. In addition, Marriott is focused on the health and well-being of not only our associates, but their families as well. In the U.S., we provide our associates with access to health care coverage, work/life support benefits, and other benefits that support families, including paid parental leave and financial assistance to help with adoption fees. We also offer comprehensive benefits programs for associates outside the U.S., the terms of which vary based on the geographic market. Beginning in 2020, we offered associates free access to a digital tool designed to help with stress management and resiliency.
At Marriott, our associates’ career well-being is a top priority and we offer programs and resources to support our associates’ career goals, from entry level to management positions. Through skills training programs, professional development opportunities and other learning experiences, we provide associates with a multitude of choices for career and personal growth. We recently launched the Digital Learning Zone, focused on providing associates personalized unique learning paths.
Our company-wide diversity, equity, and inclusion program includes a range of initiatives and programs to support our efforts to make all stakeholders – associates, guests, owners, and suppliers – feel welcome. We have oversight and accountability measures in place to support our focus on equal employment, diversity and inclusion. The Inclusion and Social Impact Committee of our Board of Directors (the “ISI Committee”) helps drive accountability across the Company. Established in 2003, the ISI Committee is chaired by a member of our Board of Directors and comprised of certain other members of the Board and the Company’s senior management team. The ISI Committee assists the Board in carrying out its commitment and responsibilities relating to Marriott’s people-first culture and the Company’s efforts to foster associate well-being and inclusion.

Sustainability and Social Impact
Guided by our 2025 sustainability and social impact goals, as well as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, we believe we have an opportunity to create a positive and sustainable impact wherever we do business. Our sustainability and social impact platform, Serve 360: Doing Good In Every Direction, is built around four focus areas: Nurture Our World; Sustain Responsible Operations; Empower Through Opportunity; and Welcome All and Advance Human Rights - each with targets to drive our efforts through 2025. These targets reflect our goals to protect and invest in the vitality of the communities and natural environments in which we operate, build and operate sustainable hotels, source responsibly, advance human rights, and mitigate climate-related risk. In 2020, many of our programs and initiatives, including the switch from single-use toiletry bottles to larger, pump-topped bottles, were slowed due to the impact of COVID-19 on our business. Nevertheless, hotels across the globe supported their local communities in need by donating food, cleaning supplies and other essential items and opening their doors to non-profits that needed large event spaces in order to adhere to social distancing protocols and still meet an increase in demand for their community-supporting services. Additionally, together with American Express and JPMorgan Chase, we provided $10 million worth of free hotel stays for frontline healthcare workers. We deployed our Marriott Disaster Relief Fund to provide essential items, such as food vouchers, to Marriott associates in need. Notwithstanding the pandemic, we made progress toward our goal to train 100 percent of on-property personnel in human trafficking awareness by 2025, and in collaboration with a leading anti-trafficking organization, we made our training open-sourced for free access to our industry and beyond. In 2021, we expect to revise and implement sustainability and social impact programming that is most pertinent to the current operating environment, while helping us to address the growing expectations of our stakeholders, increase our operational efficiency and excellence, and enhance our reputation while mitigating risk and supporting the resiliency of our business.

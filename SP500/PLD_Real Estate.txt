Prologis, Inc. is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and is the sole general partner of Prologis, L.P. through which it holds substantially all of its assets. We operate Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. as one enterprise and, therefore, our discussion and analysis refers to Prologis, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Prologis, L.P. We invest in real estate through wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities through which we co-invest with partners and investors. We have a significant ownership interest in the co-investment ventures, which may be consolidated or unconsolidated based on our level of control of the entity.

 

Prologis, Inc. began operating as a fully integrated real estate company in 1997 and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Internal Revenue Code” or “IRC”). We believe the current organization and method of operation will enable Prologis, Inc. to maintain its status as a REIT. Prologis, L.P. was also formed in 1997.

 

We operate and manage our business on an owned and managed (“O&M”) basis and therefore evaluate the operating performance of the properties in our O&M portfolio, which includes our consolidated properties and properties owned by our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, which we manage. We make operating decisions based on our total O&M portfolio, as we manage the properties similarly regardless of ownership. We evaluate our results based on our proportionate economic ownership of each property included in the O&M portfolio (“our share”) to reflect our share of the financial results of the O&M portfolio.

 

Included in our discussion below are references to funds from operations (“FFO”) and net operating income (“NOI”), neither of which are U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a reconciliation of Net Earnings Attributable to Common Stockholders in the Consolidated Statements of Income to our FFO measures and a reconciliation of NOI to Operating Income, the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

THE COMPANY

 

We are the global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high growth markets. We own, manage and develop well-located, high-quality logistics facilities in 19 countries across four continents. Our local teams actively manage our portfolio, which encompasses leasing, property management, capital deployment and opportunistic dispositions. Our disposition activities allow us to recycle capital and largely self-fund our development and acquisition activities. The majority of our properties in the United States (“U.S.”) are wholly owned, while our international properties are primarily held in our co-investment ventures, which has the benefit of mitigating our exposure to foreign currency movements.

 

Our portfolio is focused on the world’s most vibrant centers of commerce and our scale allows us to respond to our customers’ needs for the highest-quality buildings across these locations. There is an emergence of two new structural demand drivers for our real estate: (i) the need for more inventory as supply chains emphasize resilience over efficiency and (ii) the acceleration of e-commerce adoption.

3

As service time increasingly moves to the forefront of the global supply chain, it drives demand for logistics real estate close to the end-consumer. We have invested in properties located within infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with same day access (defined as Last Touch®) and next day access (defined as city distribution), to the consumer population. This positioning gives us the unique ability to provide our customers with the right real estate solutions for their supply chains that, in turn, allows them to meet end-consumer delivery expectations.

 

As we look to the future of logistics real estate, we are focused on solving our customers’ pain points, innovating in pursuit of creative solutions and operational excellence. We are listening and responding to our customers’ needs for skilled labor through initiatives to create community workforce programs to develop their talent pool, utilize our proprietary data and analytics to ensure efficient distribution solutions and negotiate better pricing on common products and services that our customers need. Our customers turn to us because they know that a strategic partnership with Prologis is a competitive advantage. We accomplish all of this by employing individuals who continue to grow, embrace change and draw strength from inclusion and diversity.

 

At December 31, 2020, we owned or had investments in properties, on a wholly-owned basis or through ventures, in the following geographies (dollars in billions, based on gross book value and total expected investment (as defined below) and square feet in millions):

 

 

2020 Significant Events

 

On January 8, 2020, our two U.S. co-investment ventures, Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture, LLC (“USLV”) and Prologis Targeted U.S. Logistics Fund (“USLF”), acquired the wholly-owned real estate assets of Industrial Property Trust Inc. (“IPT”) for approximately $2.0 billion each, which we refer to as the “IPT Transaction” and is detailed in Notes 4, 5, 8 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The portfolio included 235 properties, aggregating 37 million square feet and were highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. Our aggregate investment in the IPT Transaction was $1.6 billion.

 

On February 4, 2020, we acquired Liberty Property Trust and Liberty Property Limited Partnership (collectively “Liberty”) through a merger transaction that we refer to as the “Liberty Transaction” and is detailed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Liberty portfolio was primarily comprised of logistics real estate assets, including 519 operating properties, aggregating 100 million square feet and were highly complementary to our U.S. portfolio in terms of product quality, location and growth potential. The portfolio also included properties under development, land for future development and office properties. The acquisition expanded our presence in target markets such as Lehigh Valley, Chicago, Houston, Central Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Southern California. The total acquisition price, including transaction costs, was approximately $13 billion and was funded through the issuance of equity and the assumption of debt. As a result of the closely aligned portfolios and similar business strategy, we integrated the IPT and Liberty properties while adding minimal property management and general and administrative expenses, further scaling our operations.

 

On a combined basis, there were 42 million square feet of non-strategic industrial properties with a gross book value of approximately $3 billion acquired in both the Liberty Transaction and the IPT Transaction that we do not intend to operate long-term. Depending on the expected hold period, these assets were either classified as Assets Held for Sale or Contribution or other real estate investments within Investments in Real Estate Properties at the time of acquisition in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Since acquisition some of these non-strategic industrial properties have been sold.

In early 2020, COVID-19 was characterized as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 outbreak has disrupted financial markets and global, national and local economies since this time. Our operating results have remained strong in the COVID-19 environment and our business has been resilient. We expect operating conditions in our portfolio to continue to strengthen in 2021. However, with the continued uncertainty across the globe, we cannot predict the impact on our business, future financial condition or operating results. For discussion on current operating results and our operational and financial outlook, as well as our response to help protect employees and customers, see the Summary of 2020 section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

 

Throughout this discussion, we reflect amounts in U.S. dollars, our reporting currency. Included in these amounts are consolidated and unconsolidated investments denominated in foreign currencies, principally the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen that are impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates when translated to U.S. dollars. We mitigate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by investing outside the U.S. through co-investment ventures, borrowing in the functional currency of our subsidiaries and utilizing derivative financial instruments.

 

OPERATING SEGMENTS

 

Our business comprises two operating segments: Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital.

 

Below is information summarizing consolidated activity within our segments over the last three years (in millions):

 

 

(1)  
	

NOI from Real Estate Operations is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Rental Revenues and Development Management and Other Revenues less Rental Expenses and Other Expenses.

 

(2)
	

A developed property moves into the operating portfolio when it meets our definition of stabilization, which is the earlier of one year after completion or 90% occupancy. Amounts represent our total expected investment (“TEI”), which includes the estimated cost of development, land, construction and leasing costs.

 

 

Real Estate Operations

 

Rental. Rental operations comprise the largest component of our operating segments and generally contribute 85% to 90% of our consolidated revenues, earnings and funds from operations (“FFO”). We collect rent from our customers through operating leases, including reimbursements for the majority of our property operating costs. We expect to generate internal growth by increasing rents, maintaining high occupancy rates and controlling expenses. The primary driver of our revenue growth will be rolling in-place leases to current market rents as leases expire. We believe our active portfolio management, combined with the skills of our property, leasing, maintenance, capital, energy, sustainability and risk management teams allow us to maximize NOI across our portfolio. A majority of our consolidated rental revenue, NOI and cash flows are generated in the U.S.

 

Development. Given the scarcity of modern logistics facilities in our target markets, our development business provides us the opportunity to build what our customers need. We develop properties to meet these needs, deepen our market presence and maintain a modern portfolio. We believe we have a competitive advantage due to (i) the strategic locations of our land bank and redevelopment sites; (ii) the development expertise of our local teams; and (iii) the depth of our customer relationships. Successful development and redevelopment efforts provide significant earnings growth as projects are leased, generate income and increase the net asset value of our Real Estate Operations segment. Based on our current estimates, our consolidated land, including options, has the potential to support the development of $11.8 billion of TEI of new logistics space. In addition to our land portfolio, we have also made investments in other properties that have the potential to be redeveloped to increase value. Generally, we develop properties in the U.S. for long-term hold and outside the U.S. for contribution to our unconsolidated co-investment ventures.

 

Strategic Capital

 

Our strategic capital segment allows us to partner with many of the world’s largest institutional investors and capitalize our business through private equity, principally perpetual open-ended or long-term ventures. We also access capital in this segment through two publicly traded vehicles: Nippon Prologis REIT, Inc. in Japan and FIBRA Prologis in Mexico. We align our interests with our partners by holding significant ownership interests in all of our 9 unconsolidated co-investment ventures (ranging from 15% to 50%), which allows us to reduce our exposure to foreign currency movements for investments outside the U.S.

5

 

This segment produces stable, long-term cash flows and generally contributes 10% to 15% of our recurring consolidated revenues, earnings and FFO. We generate strategic capital revenues from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures, principally through asset and property management services. We earn additional revenues by providing leasing, acquisition, construction, development and disposition services. In certain ventures, we also have the ability to earn revenues through incentive fees (“promotes” or “promote revenues”) periodically during the life of a venture or upon liquidation. We plan to profitably grow this business by increasing our assets under management in existing or new ventures. Most of the strategic capital revenues are generated outside the U.S. NOI in this segment is calculated directly from our Consolidated Financial Statements as Strategic Capital Revenues less Strategic Capital Expenses and excludes property-related NOI.

 

FUTURE GROWTH

 

We believe the quality and scale of our global portfolio, the expertise of our team, the depth of our customer relationships and the strength of our balance sheet give us unique competitive advantages to grow revenues, NOI, earnings, FFO and cash flows.

 

 

(1)
	

General and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses is a line item in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Adjusted G&A expenses is calculated from our Consolidated Financial Statements as G&A Expenses and Strategic Capital Expenses, less expenses under the Prologis Promote Plan (“PPP”) and property-level management expenses for the properties owned by the ventures.

 

•
	

Rent Growth. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the current economic environment, we expect rents in our markets to increase due to demand for the location and quality of our properties. In addition, due to strong market rent growth over the last several years, our in-place leases have considerable upside potential. We estimate that the rental rates of our leases are 13% below current market on the basis of our weighted average ownership at December 31, 2020. Therefore, even if market rent growth is flat, a lease renewal will likely translate into increased future rental income, on a consolidated basis or through the earnings we recognize from our unconsolidated co-investment ventures based on our ownership. We have experienced positive rent change on rollover (comparing the net effective rent (“NER”) of the new lease to the prior lease for the same space) in every quarter since 2013. We expect this trend to continue for several more years due to our current in-place rents being below market. We also expect future growth in market rents to further contribute to increased rental income.

 

•
	

Value Creation from Development. A successful development and redevelopment program involves maintaining control of well-located and entitled land and redevelopment sites. We believe that the carrying value of our land bank is below its current fair value. Due to the strategic nature of our land bank, development expertise of our teams and strength of our customer relationships, we expect to create value as we build new properties. We measure the estimated value creation of a development project as the margin above our anticipated cost to develop. As properties under development stabilize, we expect to realize the value creation principally through contributions to the unconsolidated co-investment ventures and increases in the NOI of our operating portfolio.

 

•
	

Balance Sheet Strength. Through the acquisitions of Liberty and IPT and execution of several opportunistic debt refinancings at historically low rates, we further enhanced our financial position during 2020 while maintaining low leverage. At December 31, 2020, we had total available liquidity of $4.8 billion. As a result of our low leverage and available liquidity, we have significant capacity to capitalize on value-added investment opportunities that will translate into future earnings growth.

 

•
	

Economies of Scale from Growth. We use adjusted G&A expenses as a percentage of the O&M portfolio to measure and evaluate our overhead costs. We have scalable systems and infrastructure in place to grow both our consolidated and O&M portfolios with limited incremental G&A expense. We believe we can continue to grow NOI and strategic capital revenues organically and through accretive development and acquisition activity while further reducing G&A as a percentage of our investments in real estate. As noted in the graph above, the acquisitions of the Liberty and IPT portfolios are key examples of this effort, where we increased our investments in real estate in the O&M portfolio by over 20% in the first quarter of 2020 and had minimal increases to G&A expenses, which results in lower G&A expenses as a percentage of the investments in real estate.

 

•
	

Staying “Ahead of What’s Next™”. We are working on initiatives to create value beyond the real estate by enhancing our customers’ experience, utilizing our scale to streamline our procurement activities and negotiating better pricing on products and services for us and our customers, as well as delivering improvements to our business through innovation, data analytics and

6
	

digitization efforts. Underlying our future strategy for growth is our ongoing commitment to, and initiatives in, environmental stewardship, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”).

 

Competition

 

Real estate ownership is highly fragmented, and we therefore face competition from many owners and operators. Competitively priced logistics space could impact our occupancy rates and have an adverse effect on how much rent we can charge, which in turn could affect our operating results. We may face competition regarding our capital deployment activities, including local, regional and national operators or developers. We also face competition from investment managers for institutional capital within our strategic capital business.

 

Despite the competition we may face, our strategic focus over the years has given us distinct competitive advantages, including the following:

 

•
	

a portfolio of properties strategically located in markets characterized by large population densities, growing consumption and high barriers to entry, typically near large labor pools and extensive transportation infrastructure, including our Last Touch® facilities;

 

•
	

an investment in ESG practices that enhances asset values while improving sustainability performance, including the development of logistics facilities with sustainable design features that meet customer needs for high-quality buildings;

 

•
	

established relationships with customers served by our experienced and responsive local and regional teams;

 

•
	

the ability to leverage our organizational scale and structure to provide a single point of contact for our focus customers to address their needs through our in-house global customer solutions team;

 

•
	

proven property management and leasing expertise;

 

•
	

relationships and successful track record with current and prospective investors in our strategic capital business;

 

•
	

a strategically located land bank and redevelopment sites;

 

•
	

local teams with development expertise; and

 

•
	

a strong balance sheet and credit ratings, coupled with significant liquidity and borrowing capacity.

 

Customers

 

Our broad customer base represents a spectrum of international, national, regional and local logistics users. At December 31, 2020, in our Real Estate Operations segment representing our consolidated properties, we had more than 3,400 customers occupying 446 million square feet of logistics operating properties.

In order to provide for a customer-centric location strategy, we have invested in properties located within infill and urban areas in our largest global markets with same day and next day access to the consumer population, these are our Last Touch® and city distribution facilities, respectively. To support these distribution facilities, we utilize multi-market facilities located at key transportation hubs on the edge of these major infill and urban areas and gateway distribution facilities that incorporate access to major sea and intermodal ports. Below are the primary categories of goods in our buildings for our consolidated real estate properties at December 31, 2020.

NER is calculated using the estimated total cash to be received over the term of the lease divided by the lease term to determine the average amount of cash rent payments received per year. Amounts derived in a currency other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average rate from the previous year.

In our Strategic Capital segment, we view our partners and investors as our customers. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 128 investors in our private equity ventures, several of which invest in multiple ventures.

 

Employees

 

We believe our employees are the most important part of our business. When attracting, developing and retaining talent, we seek individuals who hold varied experiences and viewpoints to create an inclusive and diverse culture and workplace that allows each employee to do their best work and drive our collective success. We focus on leadership development at every level of the organization. We align employees’ goals with our overall strategic direction to create a clear link between individual efforts and the long-term success of the company and then provide effective feedback on their performance towards goals to ensure their growth. We believe a commitment to our employees’ learning and development through training, educational opportunities and mentorship is critical to our ability to continue to innovate. Through performance plans, talent recognition and individual development planning, along with reward packages, we advance our talent pool and create a sustainable and long-term enterprise. For additional discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, see the Summary of 2020 section in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

 

The following table summarizes our total number of employees at December 31, 2020:

This includes employees who were based in the U.S. but also support other geographies.

 

We allocate the personnel costs related to providing property management and leasing functions to our Real Estate Operations and Strategic Capital segments based on the square footage of the respective portfolios. The personnel costs to perform only Strategic Capital functions are allocated directly to that segment.

 

We believe we have good relationships with our employees. Prologis employees are not organized under collective bargaining agreements, other than in Brazil, although some employees in Europe are represented by statutory Works Councils and as such, benefit from applicable labor agreements.

 

CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT

 

We maintain a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct applicable to our board of directors (the “Board”) and all of our officers and employees, including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the principal accounting officer, and other people performing similar functions. A copy of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website, www.prologis.com. In addition to being accessible through our website, copies of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct can be obtained, free of charge, upon written request to Investor Relations, Pier 1, Bay 1, San Francisco, California 94111. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that apply to the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer, the principal accounting officer, or other people performing similar functions, and that relate to any matter enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K, will be disclosed on our website.

 

ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP, SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GOVERNANCE (“ESG”)

 

Our long-standing dedication to ESG creates value for our company by strengthening our relationships with our customers, investors, employees and the communities in which we do business. The principles of ESG are an important aspect of our business strategy, delivering a strategic business advantage while positively impacting the environment. We develop modern and efficient building designs with state-of-the-art technology to stay ahead of our customers’ needs while advancing structural, transportation, and energy requirements. We invest in sustainable design features and practices, such as the addition of solar panels, cool roofs, light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting, electric vehicle charging stations, waste diversion, recycling and xeriscaping, that result in cost-savings and operational efficiency for our customers and reduce energy and water consumption, as well as decrease greenhouse gas emissions across our portfolio and corporate operations. We have a comprehensive carbon strategy that includes science-based targets to address our global carbon footprint.

 

We are committed to social responsibility and strengthening relationships important to our business through customer partnerships, investor outreach, community involvement, labor solutions, and inclusion and diversity initiatives, as well as a focus on our employees and our customers’ employees through health and wellness programs and building design. Through our community workforce initiative, for example, we are helping build a talent pipeline for our customers with an emphasis on revitalizing career pathways and creating economic opportunities in the communities where we operate. We set an ambitious goal to train 25,000 individuals by 2025 by partnering with leading public sector organizations and leveraging learning technologies to develop innovative training solutions.

 

Our strong governance and oversight creates a culture of uncompromising integrity. Our Board independence and diversity, open communication with our stockholders and a risk management framework that supports our investment and process decisions all serve

9

to mitigate risk and preserve value for our company. The strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, ability to stay ahead of customer needs, and engagement with our employees through ethics and anti-corruption training, along with stockholder outreach ensures the financial, operational and reputational resilience of our organization for the long-term. Our approach is reinforced by our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, as described above.

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

We are exposed to various environmental risks that may result in unanticipated losses and affect our operating results and financial condition. Either the previous owners or we have conducted environmental reviews on a majority of the properties we have acquired, including land. While some of these assessments have led to further investigation and sampling, none of the environmental assessments have revealed an environmental liability that we think would have a material adverse effect beyond amounts recorded as of December 31, 2020. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

 

GOVERNMENTAL MATTERS

 

We are exposed to various regulatory requirements, taxes, tariffs, trade wars and laws within the countries in which we operate and unexpected changes in these items may result in unanticipated losses, adverse tax consequences and affect our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be impacted by the ability of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to distribute or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries due to currency exchange control regulations and transfer pricing regulations. The impact of regional or country-specific economic instability, including government shutdowns or other internal trade alliances or agreements could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

 

INSURANCE COVERAGE

 

We carry insurance coverage on our properties. We determine the type of coverage and the policy specifications and limits based on what we deem to be the risks associated with our ownership of properties and our business operations in specific markets. Such coverage typically includes property damage and rental loss insurance resulting from such perils as fire, windstorm, flood, earthquake and terrorism; commercial general liability insurance; and environmental insurance. Insurance is maintained through a combination of commercial insurance, self-insurance and a wholly-owned captive insurance entity. The costs to insure our properties are primarily covered through expense reimbursements from our customers. We believe our insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits that are customary for similar properties, business activities and markets and we believe our properties are adequately insured. See further discussion in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

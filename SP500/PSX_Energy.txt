CORPORATE STRUCTURE

Phillips 66, headquartered in Houston, Texas, was incorporated in Delaware in 2011 in connection with, and in anticipation of, a restructuring of ConocoPhillips that separated its downstream businesses into an independent, publicly traded company named Phillips 66. The two companies were separated by ConocoPhillips distributing to its stockholders all the shares of common stock of Phillips 66 after the market closed on April 30, 2012 (the separation). Phillips 66 stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the “PSX” stock symbol.

Our business is organized into four operating segments:

1)Midstream—Provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation, terminaling and processing services, as well as natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) transportation, storage, fractionation, processing and marketing services, mainly in the United States. This segment includes our master limited partnership (MLP), Phillips 66 Partners LP (Phillips 66 Partners), as well as our 50% equity investment in DCP Midstream, LLC (DCP Midstream).

2)Chemicals—Consists of our 50% equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem), which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis.

3)Refining—Refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, at 13 refineries in the United States and Europe.

4)Marketing and Specialties (M&S)—Purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products, mainly in the United States and Europe. In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products, such as base oils and lubricants.

Corporate and Other includes general corporate overhead, interest expense, our investment in new technologies and various other corporate activities. Corporate assets include all cash, cash equivalents and income tax-related assets.

SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION


MIDSTREAM

The Midstream segment consists of three business lines:

•Transportation—Transports crude oil and other feedstocks to our refineries and other locations, delivers refined petroleum products to market, and provides terminaling and storage services for crude oil and refined petroleum products.

•NGL and Other—Transports, stores, fractionates, exports and markets NGL and provides other fee-based processing services.

•DCP Midstream—Gathers, processes, transports and markets natural gas and transports, fractionates and markets NGL.

Phillips 66 Partners
Phillips 66 Partners, headquartered in Houston, Texas, is a publicly traded MLP formed in 2013 to own, operate, develop and acquire primarily fee-based midstream assets. At December 31, 2020, we owned 170 million Phillips 66 Partners common units, representing a 74% limited partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners, while the public owned a 26% limited partner interest and 13.8 million perpetual convertible preferred units. We also own a noneconomic general partner interest.

Phillips 66 Partners’ operations consist of crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL transportation, terminaling, fractionation, processing and storage assets that are geographically dispersed throughout the United States. The majority of Phillips 66 Partners’ assets are associated with, and integral to, Phillips 66 operated refineries.

The results of operations of Phillips 66 Partners are included in Midstream’s Transportation and NGL and Other business lines, based on the nature of the activity within the partnership.

Transportation

We own or lease various assets to provide transportation, terminaling and storage services. These assets include crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL, and natural gas pipeline systems; crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL terminals; a petroleum coke handling facility; marine vessels; railcars and trucks.

Pipelines and Terminals
At December 31, 2020, our Transportation business was comprised of over 22,000 miles of crude oil, refined petroleum product, NGL and natural gas pipeline systems in the United States, including those partially owned or operated by our affiliates. We owned or operated 39 refined petroleum product terminals, 20 crude oil terminals, 5 NGL terminals, a petroleum coke exporting facility and various other storage and loading facilities.

The Beaumont Terminal in Nederland, Texas, is the largest terminal in the Phillips 66 portfolio. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed construction of a new 200,000 barrels per day (BPD) dock at the Beaumont Terminal, bringing the terminal’s total dock capacity to 800,000 BPD. At December 31, 2020, the terminal had total crude oil and refined petroleum product storage capacity of 16.8 million barrels.

The Gray Oak Pipeline transports up to 900,000 BPD of crude oil from the Permian and Eagle Ford to Texas Gulf Coast destinations that include Corpus Christi, Texas, and the Sweeny area, including our Sweeny Refinery. The pipeline made its first commercial delivery in November 2019 and commenced full operations in the second quarter of 2020. Phillips 66 Partners has a 42.25% effective ownership interest in the pipeline.

Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25% interest in the South Texas Gateway Terminal, which connects to the Gray Oak Pipeline in Corpus Christi, Texas. The first dock of the marine export terminal began crude oil export operations in July 2020. The second dock commenced crude oil export operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. Upon completion in the first quarter of 2021, the marine export terminal will have storage capacity of 8.6 million barrels and up to 800,000 BPD of dock throughput capacity.

Phillips 66 Partners continued construction of a 16 inch ethane pipeline (C2G Pipeline) that will connect its Clemens Caverns storage facility to petrochemical facilities in Gregory, Texas. The project is backed by long-term commitments and is expected to be completed in mid-2021.

The Liberty Pipeline joint venture was formed to transport crude oil from the Rockies and Bakken production areas to Cushing, Oklahoma. Phillips 66 Partners holds a 50% interest in the joint venture. In March 2020, Phillips 66 Partners deferred the Liberty Pipeline system project due to the challenging business environment.

In the third quarter of 2020, the project to develop and construct the Red Oak Pipeline system was canceled. We hold a 50% interest in the joint venture that was pursuing this project.

The Dakota Access Pipeline is currently subject to litigation that could affect operations. See the “Dakota Access, LLC (Dakota Access) and Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC (ETCO)” section of Note 6—Investments, Loans and Long-Term Receivables, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information on this litigation.

Marine Vessels
At December 31, 2020, we had 12 international-flagged crude oil, refined petroleum product and NGL tankers under time charter contracts, with capacities ranging in size from 300,000 to 2,200,000 barrels.  Additionally, we had a variety of inland and offshore tug/barge units.  These vessels are used primarily to transport crude oil and other feedstocks, as well as refined petroleum products for our refineries.  In addition, the NGL tankers are used to export propane and butane from our fractionation, transportation and storage infrastructure.

Truck and Rail
Our truck and rail fleets support our feedstock and distribution operations. Rail movements are provided via a fleet of approximately 9,700 owned and leased railcars. Truck movements are provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Sentinel Transportation LLC, and through numerous third-party trucking companies.

NGL and Other

Our NGL and Other business includes the following:

•The Sweeny Hub, a U.S. Gulf Coast NGL market hub with 400,000 BPD of total fractionation capacity, a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) export terminal and NGL storage caverns.

•A 22.5% interest in Gulf Coast Fractionators, which owns an NGL fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our net share of its capacity is 32,625 BPD. In December 2020, we began the process to idle this facility and transfer operatorship to a co-venturer.

•A 12.5% undivided interest in a fractionation plant in Mont Belvieu, Texas. Our net share of its capacity is 30,250 BPD.

•A 40% undivided interest in a fractionation plant in Conway, Kansas. Our net share of its capacity is 43,200 BPD.

•Phillips 66 Partners owns the River Parish NGL logistics system in southeast Louisiana, comprising approximately 500 miles of pipeline and a storage cavern connecting multiple fractionation facilities, refineries and a petrochemical facility.

•Phillips 66 Partners owns a direct one-third interest in both the DCP Sand Hills Pipeline, LLC (Sand Hills) and DCP Southern Hills Pipeline, LLC (Southern Hills), which own NGL pipeline systems that connect the Eagle Ford, Permian Basin and Midcontinent production areas to the Mont Belvieu, Texas, market hub.

•Phillips 66 Partners owns a vacuum distillation unit with a capacity of 125,000 BPD and a delayed coker unit with a capacity of 70,000 BPD located at our Sweeny Refinery in Old Ocean, Texas.

•Phillips 66 Partners owns a 25,000 BPD isomerization unit at our Lake Charles Refinery. The isomerization unit increases Phillips 66’s production of higher-octane gasoline blend components.

The Sweeny Hub fractionators are located adjacent to our Sweeny Refinery in Old Ocean, Texas, and supply purity ethane to the petrochemical industry and purity NGL to domestic and global markets. Raw NGL supply to the fractionators is delivered from nearby major pipelines, including the Sand Hills Pipeline. The fractionators are supported by significant infrastructure including connectivity to two NGL supply pipelines, a pipeline connecting to the Mont Belvieu market hub and the Clemens Caverns storage facility with access to our LPG export terminal in Freeport, Texas.

During 2020, Phillips 66 completed two new 150,000 BPD fractionators at the Sweeny Hub, bringing the site’s total fractionation capacity to 400,000 BPD. Frac 2 and Frac 3 commenced commercial operations in September 2020 and October 2020, respectively. The fractionators are supported by long-term customer commitments. The construction and development of Frac 4, a new 150,000 BPD fractionator at the Sweeny Hub, is expected to resume in the second half of 2021, after a temporary deferral announced in March 2020.

During the second quarter of 2020, Phillips 66 Partners completed the expansion of storage capacity at Clemens Caverns from 9 million barrels to 16.5 million barrels.

The Freeport LPG Export Terminal leverages our fractionation, transportation and storage infrastructure to supply petrochemical, heating and transportation markets globally. The terminal can simultaneously load two ships with refrigerated propane and butane at a combined rate of approximately 36,000 barrels per hour. In addition, the terminal has the capability to export natural gasoline (C5+) produced by the Sweeny Hub fractionators.

DCP Midstream

Our Midstream segment includes our 50% equity investment in DCP Midstream, which is headquartered in Denver, Colorado. At December 31, 2020, DCP Midstream, through its subsidiary DCP Midstream, LP (DCP Partners), owned or operated 39 active natural gas processing facilities, with a net processing capacity of approximately 6.0 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), and approximately 57,000 miles of natural gas and NGL pipelines. DCP Midstream’s owned or operated natural gas pipeline systems included gathering services for these facilities and natural gas transmission. DCP Midstream also owned or operated 9 NGL fractionation plants, along with natural gas and NGL storage facilities and NGL pipelines.

The residual natural gas, primarily methane, which results from processing raw natural gas, is sold by DCP Midstream at market-based prices to marketers and end users, including large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities. DCP Midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers, principally under contractual arrangements that expose DCP Midstream to the prices of NGL, natural gas and condensate. DCP Midstream also has fee-based arrangements with producers to provide midstream services such as gathering and processing. In addition, DCP Midstream markets a portion of its NGL to us and our equity affiliates under existing contracts.

During 2020, DCP Midstream completed the following growth projects:

•The Cheyenne Connector was placed into service in the second quarter of 2020, adding 600 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d) of residue gas takeaway and easing logistics constraints in the DJ Basin.

•The Front Range pipeline was expanded to a capacity of 260,000 BPD and the Texas Express pipeline was expanded to a capacity of 370,000 BPD in the second quarter of 2020.

•The Latham 2 offload was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2020, adding up to 225 MMcf/d of incremental DJ Basin processing capacity.

CHEMICALS

The Chemicals segment consists of our 50% equity investment in CPChem, which is headquartered in The Woodlands, Texas. At December 31, 2020, CPChem owned or had joint venture interests in 28 manufacturing facilities located in Belgium, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States. Additionally, CPChem has two research and development centers in the United States.

We structure our reporting of CPChem’s operations around two primary business lines: Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) and Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S). The O&P business line produces and markets ethylene and other olefin products. The ethylene produced is primarily used by CPChem to produce polyethylene, normal alpha olefins (NAO) and polyethylene pipe. The SA&S business line manufactures and markets aromatics and styrenics products, such as benzene, cyclohexane, styrene and polystyrene. SA&S also manufactures and/or markets a variety of specialty chemical products including organosulfur chemicals, solvents, catalysts, and chemicals used in drilling and mining.

The manufacturing of petrochemicals and plastics involves the conversion of hydrocarbon-based raw material feedstocks into higher-value products, often through a thermal process referred to in the industry as “cracking.” For example, ethylene can be produced by cracking ethane, propane, butane, natural gasoline or certain refinery liquids, such as naphtha and gas oil. Ethylene primarily is used as a raw material in the production of plastics, such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Plastic resins, such as polyethylene, are manufactured in a thermal/catalyst process, and the produced output is used as a further raw material for various applications, such as packaging and plastic pipe.

The following table reflects CPChem’s petrochemicals and plastics product capacities at December 31, 2020:

MARKETING AND SPECIALTIES

Our M&S segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products, such as gasoline, distillates and aviation fuels, mainly in the United States and Europe. In addition, this segment includes the manufacturing and marketing of specialty products, such as base oils and lubricants.

Marketing

Marketing—United States
We market gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel through marketer and joint venture outlets that utilize the Phillips 66, Conoco or 76 brands. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 7,590 branded outlets in 48 states and Puerto Rico.

Our wholesale operations utilize a network of marketers operating approximately 5,440 outlets. We place a strong emphasis on the wholesale channel of trade because of its relatively lower capital requirements. In addition, we hold brand-licensing agreements covering approximately 1,370 sites. Our refined petroleum products are marketed on both a branded and unbranded basis. A high percentage of our branded marketing sales are in the Midcontinent, Rockies and West Coast regions, where our wholesale marketing network secures efficient offtake from our refineries. We also utilize consignment fuel arrangements with several marketers whereby we own the fuel inventory and pay the marketers a monthly fee.

In the Gulf Coast and East Coast regions, most sales are conducted via the unbranded channel of trade, which does not require a highly integrated marketing network to secure product placement for refinery pull through. We have export capability at our U.S. coastal refineries to meet international demand.

In addition to automotive gasoline and diesel, we produce and market aviation gasoline and jet fuel. Aviation gasoline and jet fuel are sold through dealers and independent marketers at approximately 780 Phillips 66 branded locations.

We also participate in retail joint ventures to secure long-term placement of our refinery production and extend participation in the retail value chain. At December 31, 2020, our joint ventures had approximately 730 outlets. During the second quarter of 2020, our West Coast retail joint venture completed the acquisition of 95 additional sites. In January 2021, one of our joint ventures in the Central region acquired 106 retail sites.

Marketing—International
We have marketing operations in four European countries. Our European marketing strategy is to sell primarily through owned, leased or joint venture retail sites using a low-cost, high-volume approach. We use the JET brand name to market retail and wholesale products in Austria, Germany and the United Kingdom. In addition, we have an equity interest in a joint venture that markets refined petroleum products in Switzerland under the COOP brand name.

We also market aviation fuels, LPG, heating oils, marine bunker fuels, and other secondary refined products to commercial customers and into the bulk or spot markets in the above countries.

At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,280 marketing outlets in Europe, of which approximately 990 were company owned and approximately 290 were dealer owned. We had interests in approximately 330 additional sites through our COOP joint venture operations in Switzerland, and we held brand-licensing agreements covering approximately 90 sites in Mexico.

We continued our program to update signature image designs for JET branded sites in Europe.

In addition, we believe a high level of performance can only be achieved through an inclusive culture and diverse workforce. Our inclusion and diversity (I&D) council, chaired by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and comprised of executives and business leaders, sets the strategic vision for advancing I&D. We have eight Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that align with our corporate objective of fostering a diverse workforce. These ERGs are organizations formed around a shared set of experiences and perspectives, and are focused on professional development, networking, recruiting, raising cultural awareness, and community involvement.

We conduct biennial employee engagement surveys to gather employee perspectives on their experience, the results of which are available to employees and our board of directors. Management analyzes findings to identify progress on previous recommendations and areas of continued opportunity.

•Capability—We strive to build depth and breadth in our skills. We drive employee development through technical training and providing opportunities for rotational moves, as well as assisting employees with obtaining and sharpening managerial skills through targeted development programs and promotional moves. Our performance management process identifies coaching and training needs.

We also have a robust succession planning practice and work each year to identify successors for positions within the company. As part of the process, quarterly sessions are held with executives to monitor and guide leadership development for our key corporate positions.

COMPETITION

In the Midstream segment, our crude oil and products pipelines face competition from other crude oil and products pipeline companies, major integrated oil companies, and independent crude oil gathering and marketing companies.  Competition is based primarily on quality of customer service, competitive pricing and proximity to customers and market hubs. In addition, the Midstream segment, through our equity investment in DCP Midstream and our other operations, competes with numerous integrated petroleum companies, as well as natural gas transmission and distribution companies, to deliver components of natural gas to end users in natural gas markets. Principal methods of competing include economically securing the right to purchase raw natural gas for gathering systems, managing the pressure of those systems, operating efficient NGL processing plants and securing markets for the products produced. In the Chemicals segment, CPChem is ranked among the top 10 producers in many of its major product lines according to published industry sources, based on average 2020 production capacity. Petroleum products, petrochemicals and plastics are typically delivered into the worldwide commodity markets. Our Refining and M&S segments compete primarily in the United States and Europe. We are one of the largest refiners of petroleum products in the United States. Elements of competition for both our Chemicals and Refining segments include product improvement, new product development, low-cost structures, ability to run advantaged feedstocks, and efficient manufacturing and distribution systems. In the marketing portion of the business, competitive factors include product properties, reliability of supply, customer service, price and credit terms, advertising and sales promotion, and development of customer loyalty to branded products.


GENERAL

At December 31, 2020, we held a total of 501 active patents in 22 countries worldwide, including 391 active U.S. patents. The overall profitability of any business segment is not dependent on any single patent, trademark, license or franchise.

In support of our goal to attain zero incidents, we have implemented a comprehensive Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) management system to support consistent management of HSE risks across our enterprise.  The management system is designed to ensure that personal safety, process safety, and environmental impact risks are identified, and mitigation steps are taken to reduce the risk.  The management system requires periodic audits to ensure compliance with government regulations, as well as our internal requirements. Our commitment to continuous improvement is reflected in annual goal setting and performance measurement.

We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the United States and other countries. In addition, various states have authority under the federal statutes and many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. State and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violating these laws and regulations. The material effects of compliance with these government regulations upon our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position are primarily associated with environmental regulations. See the environmental information contained in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Contingencies” under the captions “Environmental” and “Climate Change.” It includes information on expensed and capitalized environmental costs for 2020 and those expected for 2021 and 2022.

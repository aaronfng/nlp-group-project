Overview

BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $8.68 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2020. With approximately 16,500 employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment management and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.

BlackRock’s diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes enables the Company to tailor investment outcomes and asset allocation solutions for clients. Product offerings include single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and money market instruments. Products are offered directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds, iShares® exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), separate accounts, collective trust funds and other pooled investment vehicles. BlackRock also offers technology services, including the investment and risk management technology platform, Aladdin®, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix and FutureAdvisor, as well as advisory services and solutions to a broad base of institutional and wealth management clients. The Company is highly regulated and manages its clients’ assets as a fiduciary. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.

BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.

BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management and technology service relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through third-party distribution relationships, including financial professionals and pension consultants.

BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over 85% of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors.

Management seeks to deliver value for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on BlackRock’s differentiated competitive position, including:

 
	

•
	

the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products;

 
	

•
	

the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 50% of employees outside the United States serving clients locally and supporting local investment capabilities. Approximately 40% of total AUM is managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;

 
	

•
	

the Company’s breadth of investment strategies, including market-cap weighted index, factors, systematic active, traditional fundamental active, high conviction alpha and illiquid alternative product offerings, which enhance its ability to tailor whole-portfolio investment solutions to address specific client needs;

 
	

•
	

the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to index investing and ETFs, a focus on income and retirement, increasing demand for sustainable investment strategies and barbelling using index, active and illiquid alternatives products; and

 
	

•
	

the Company’s longstanding commitment to innovation, technology services and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BlackRock technology products and solutions, including Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, eFront, Cachematrix, and FutureAdvisor. This commitment is further extended by minority investments in distribution technologies including Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Embark. In January 2021, BlackRock also announced a minority investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform.

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace impacted by changing market dynamics and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.

The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in Aladdin and other technology products and services. New business efforts depend on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives, in a manner consistent with their risk preferences, to deliver excellent client service and to innovate in technology to serve clients’ evolving needs. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures.

See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures, for further information on non-GAAP financial measures and for as adjusted items for 2020 and 2019.

In 2018 and 2016, a restructuring charge, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted compensation awards, has been excluded to provide more meaningful analysis of BlackRock’s ongoing operations and to ensure comparability among periods presented. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC has been excluded because it ultimately did not impact BlackRock’s book value.

(3)
	

Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items referred to above and exclude the effect on deferred income tax expense resulting from certain income tax matters. In 2017, $1.2 billion of net tax benefit related to The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was excluded from net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted.

AUM represents the broad range of financial assets managed for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which BlackRock provides risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that the Company is retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.

Investment management fees are typically earned as a percentage of AUM. BlackRock also earns performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, the Company also may earn securities lending revenue. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietary Aladdin investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing, advisory and other technology services, to institutional investors and wealth management intermediaries. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, implementation go-lives, software solution delivery and support, and hosting services.

At December 31, 2020, total AUM was $8.68 trillion, representing a CAGR of 13% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net inflows and acquisitions, including BofA Global Capital Management, which added $80.6 billion of AUM in 2016, the First Reserve Transaction, which added $3.3 billion of AUM in 2017 and the net AUM impact from the TCP Transaction, the Citibanamex Transaction, the Aegon Transaction and the DSP Transaction, which added $27.5 billion of AUM in 2018. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.

 

The Company considers the categorization of its AUM by client type, product type, investment style, and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:

Client Type

BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, with a regionally focused business model. BlackRock leverages the benefits of scale across global investment, risk and technology platforms while at the same time using local distribution presence to deliver solutions for clients. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent.  

Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail intermediaries.

iShares ETFs are a growing component of both institutional and retail client portfolios. However, as iShares ETFs are traded on exchanges, complete transparency on the ultimate end-client is unavailable. Therefore, iShares ETFs are presented as a separate client type below, with investments in iShares ETFs by institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections.

AUM by investment style and client type at December 31, 2020 is presented below.

Retail

BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the investment spectrum, including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Technology solutions, digital distribution tools and a shift toward portfolio construction are increasing the number of financial advisors and end-retail clients using BlackRock products.

Retail represented 11% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2020 and 31% of long-term investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue (collectively “base fees”) for 2020.

iShares ETFs have a significant retail component but is shown separately below. With the exclusion of iShares ETFs, retail AUM is predominantly comprised of active mutual funds. Mutual funds totaled $694.9 billion, or 82%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. 86% of retail long-term AUM is invested in active products.

Institutional active AUM ended 2020 at $1.5 trillion, reflecting $31.6 billion of net inflows, positive across all asset classes. Multi-asset strategies saw continued growth, with net inflows of $13.6 billion reflecting ongoing demand for solutions offerings and the LifePath® target-date suite.  

 

Alternatives net inflows of $9.5 billion were led by inflows into infrastructure, private equity and private credit. Excluding return of capital and investment of $7.5 billion, alternatives net inflows were $17.0 billion. In addition, 2020 was another strong fundraising year for illiquid alternatives, and at year-end 2020 BlackRock had approximately $24 billion of non-fee-earning committed capital to deploy for institutional clients, which is not included in AUM.

 

Institutional active represented 19% of long-term AUM and 20% of long-term base fees for 2020.

Institutional index AUM totaled $2.9 trillion at December 31, 2020, reflecting $28.7 billion of net outflows. Equity net outflows of $68.5 billion partially resulted from clients rebalancing portfolios after significant equity market gains, or tactically shifting assets to fixed income and cash. Fixed income net inflows of $39.7 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions.

Institutional index represented 37% of long-term AUM and 9% of long-term base fees for 2020.

The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:

 
	

•
	

Pensions, Foundations and Endowments. BlackRock is among the world’s largest managers of pension plan assets with $3.0 trillion, or 66%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2020. The market landscape continues to shift from defined benefit to defined contribution, and our defined contribution channel represented $1.2 trillion of total pension AUM. BlackRock remains well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $76.9 billion, or 2%, of long-term institutional AUM was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.

 
	

•
	

Official Institutions. BlackRock managed $275.4 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2020. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.  

 
	

•
	

Financial and Other Institutions. BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $450.3 billion, or 10%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end 2020. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which the Company provides sub-advisory services, totaled $696.6 billion, or 16%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Long-term product offerings include alpha-seeking active and index strategies. Our alpha-seeking active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile and leverage fundamental research and quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products and iShares ETFs.

Although many clients use both alpha-seeking active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class or may use a combination of index strategies to target active returns. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. Net flows in institutional index products generally have a small impact on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.

Equity

Year-end 2020 equity AUM totaled $4.4 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $49.0 billion. Net inflows included $76.3 billion and $30.2 billion into iShares ETFs and active, respectively, partially offset by non-ETF index net outflows of $57.5 billion. Record active equity net inflows were driven by flows into high-performing technology, health sciences and US growth fundamental equities franchises, as well as flows into quantitative strategies.

BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than US equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which may not consistently move in tandem with US markets, have a greater impact on BlackRock’s equity revenues and effective fee rate.

Equity represented 55% of long-term AUM and 50% of long-term base fees for 2020.

Fixed Income

Fixed income AUM ended 2020 at $2.7 trillion, reflecting net inflows of $158.0 billion. iShares ETFs net inflows of $89.0 billion were led by flows into US investment grade corporate, core and high yield bond funds. Non-ETF index net inflows of $42.1 billion were driven by demand for liability-driven investment solutions and index mutual funds. Active net inflows of $26.9 billion reflected strong flows in high yield, Asian, total return and core bond offerings.

Fixed income represented 34% of long-term AUM and 30% of long-term base fees for 2020.

Multi-Asset

BlackRock manages a variety of multi-asset balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, bonds, currencies and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.

Multi-asset represented 8% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees for 2020.

Multi-asset net inflows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $13.0 billion of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows and contributed $14.8 billion to institutional multi-asset net inflows in 2020, primarily into target date and target risk product offerings.

The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:

 
	

•
	

Target date and target risk products generated net inflows of $21.3 billion. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans representing 84% of AUM. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in our LifePath offerings. LifePath products utilize a proprietary active asset allocation overlay model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing. Underlying investments are primarily index products.

 
	

•
	

Asset allocation and balanced products represented 29% of multi-asset AUM at year-end. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income fund families. This category also includes FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients’ investments.

 
	

•
	

Fiduciary management services are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of investment management, often with BlackRock acting as outsourced chief investment officer. These customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.

Alternatives

BlackRock alternatives focus on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products fall into three main categories — 1) illiquid alternatives, 2) liquid alternatives, and 3) currency and commodities. Illiquid alternatives include offerings in alternative solutions, private equity, opportunistic and credit, real estate and infrastructure. Liquid alternatives include offerings in direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions (funds of funds).

In 2020, liquid and illiquid alternatives generated a combined $17.4 billion of net inflows, or $25.7 billion excluding return of capital/investment of $8.3 billion. The largest contributors to return of capital/investment were private equity solutions, infrastructure and opportunistic and credit strategies. Net inflows were driven by direct hedge funds, infrastructure, private equity and opportunistic and credit strategies. At year-end, BlackRock had approximately $24 billion of non-fee paying, unfunded, uninvested commitments, which are expected to be deployed in future years; these commitments are not included in AUM or flows until they are fee-paying. Currency and commodities saw $19.8 billion of net inflows, primarily into commodities iShares ETFs.

BlackRock believes that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies, investors will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. BlackRock’s highly diversified alternatives franchise is well positioned to continue to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.

Alternatives represented 3% of long-term AUM and 10% of long-term base fees for 2020.

Illiquid Alternatives

The Company’s illiquid alternatives strategies include the following:

 
	

•
	

Alternative Solutions represents highly customized portfolios of alternative investments. In 2020, alternative solutions portfolios had $4.3 billion in AUM.

 
	

•
	

Private Equity and Opportunistic included AUM of $16.9 billion in private equity solutions, $13.0 billion in opportunistic and credit offerings, and $3.5 billion in Long Term Private Capital (“LTPC”). Net inflows of $5.4 billion into private equity and opportunistic strategies included $2.6 billion of net inflows into private equity solutions, $1.8 billion of net inflows into opportunistic and credit offerings and $1.0 billion of net inflows into LTPC.

 
	

•
	

Real Assets, which includes infrastructure and real estate, totaled $48.0 billion in AUM, reflecting net inflows of $5.3 billion, led by infrastructure deployments.

Liquid Alternatives

The Company’s liquid alternatives products’ net inflows of $6.5 billion reflected net inflows of $5.7 billion and $0.8 billion from direct hedge funds and hedge fund solutions, respectively. Direct hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single- and multi-strategy offerings.

Currency and Commodities

The Company’s currency and commodities products include a range of active and index products.

Currency and commodities products had $19.8 billion of net inflows, primarily driven by iShares ETFs. iShares ETFs commodities products represented $67.6 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.

Cash Management

Cash management AUM totaled $666.3 billion at December 31, 2020, reflecting a record $113.3 billion of net inflows. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds, short term investment funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are denominated in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, Swiss Francs, New Taiwan Dollars or British pounds. Strong growth in cash management reflects BlackRock’s success in leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions.

BlackRock is currently voluntarily waiving a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintain a minimum level of daily net investment income. During 2020, these waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $35 million, which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock’s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. BlackRock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of yield support waivers in future periods. For more information see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.

Americas

Net inflows of $196.6 billion reflected net inflows into fixed income, cash, equity, alternatives, advisory and multi-asset of $88.2 billion, $80.4 billion, $22.5 billion, $20.4 billion and $13.3 billion, respectively. Equity net outflows of $28.2 billion were primarily due to low-fee institutional index outflows. Advisory net inflows were primarily linked to asset purchases managed by our Financial Markets Advisory group.  Revenue linked to these assignments is primarily reflected in the “Advisory and other revenue” line item of the Income Statement. During the year, BlackRock served clients through offices in 35 states in the United States as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and the Dominican Republic.

The Americas represented 65% of total AUM and 66% of total base fees for 2020.

EMEA

EMEA net inflows of $128.6 billion were led by equity, cash and alternatives net inflows of $81.3 billion, $32.2 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively. Offerings include fund families in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Dublin and iShares ETFs listed on stock exchanges throughout Europe, as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products.

EMEA represented 28% of total AUM and base fees for 2020.

Asia-Pacific

Asia-Pacific net inflows of $65.7 billion were primarily due to fixed income net inflows of $68.5 billion. Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, China, and India.

Asia-Pacific represented 7% of total AUM and 6% of total base fees for 2020.

TECHNOLOGY SERVICES

BlackRock offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools on a fee basis. Aladdin is our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment and risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of institutional investors around the world. BlackRock offers risk reporting capabilities via Aladdin Risk, as well as investment accounting capabilities. Aladdin Provider is a tool used by BlackRock’s custodial partners, connecting them to the platform to add operational efficiency. In 2020, BlackRock launched Aladdin Climate, a software application offering investors measures of both the physical risk of climate change and the transition risk to a low-carbon economy on portfolios with climate-adjusted security valuations and risk metrics. In 2019, BlackRock acquired eFront, a leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider to enable clients to manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform. Through our Cachematrix platform, BlackRock is also a leading provider of financial technology which simplifies the cash management process for banks and their corporate clients in a streamlined, open-architecture platform.

BlackRock offers a number of wealth management technology tools offering digital advice, portfolio construction capabilities and risk analytics for retail distributors. These tools include Aladdin Wealth, which provides wealth management firms and their financial professionals with institutional-quality business management, portfolio construction, modeling and risk analytics capabilities, and FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth management platform that provides financial institutions with technology-enabled investment advisory capabilities to manage their clients’ investments.

Technology services revenue of $1.1 billion was up 17% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin. Aladdin, which represented the majority of technology services revenue for the year, continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Aladdin assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide recurring revenue.

At year-end, BlackRock technology services clients included banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, asset servicers, retail distributors and other investors across North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

In addition, BlackRock has made minority investments in the digital distribution companies Envestnet, Scalable Capital, iCapital, Acorns and Embark. In January 2021, BlackRock also announced a minority investment in Clarity AI, a sustainability analytics and data science platform. BlackRock records its share of income related to minority investments accounted for under the equity method in other revenue and records gains and losses related to changes in value of other minority investments in nonoperating income (expense).

Securities Lending

Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. BlackRock receives both cash (primarily for US domiciled portfolios) and noncash collateral under securities lending arrangements. The cash management team invests the cash received as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending for US domiciled portfolios can be structured as a share of earnings, or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral or both. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned are captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $352 billion, up from $290 billion at year-end 2019. Continued asset gathering in lending products and strong market performance resulted in higher balances compared to 2019. On average, relative to 2019, intrinsic lending spreads were lower, while average cash reinvestment spreads increased. Cash reinvestment spreads increased significantly in the second quarter, primarily as a result of cuts to the Federal Funds Target rate band in March and market dislocations during the period.

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation and reporting of the profile of the portfolios identify that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived temporarily, such waivers are infrequent.

Risk & Quantitative Analysis

Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and enterprise risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.

COMPETITION

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, price, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.

HUMAN CAPITAL

With approximately 16,500 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. As an asset manager, BlackRock’s long-term sustainability depends on its people and how it manages its workforce.

Culture and Principles

BlackRock believes that developing a strong corporate culture is an important component of its human capital management practices and critical to the firm’s long-term success. BlackRock’s culture is underpinned by five core principles that unify its workforce: (1) We are a fiduciary to our clients; (2) We are One BlackRock; (3) We are passionate about performance; (4) We take emotional ownership; and (5) We are committed to a better future.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”)

BlackRock believes a diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive working environment are key factors in achieving better outcomes across all levels of its business. BlackRock has made a long-term commitment to cultivating diversity in its workforce and leadership team, through its hiring, retention, promotion and development practices. As part of its long-term commitment, BlackRock has instituted a multi-year DEI strategy that it believes is actionable, measurable and designed to apply across the many countries in which the firm operates. The Company has aligned its DEI strategy with the firm’s business priorities and long-term objectives and expects that it will evolve as the firm learns and adapts to a changing macro environment.  

A key goal of BlackRock’s DEI strategy is developing a diverse talent pipeline through ongoing investment in recruiting, retention and engagement. In connection with this goal, the Company has: (1) expanded partnerships with external organizations and developed strategies to increase the diversity of its applicant pool; (2) strengthened talent acquisition and management processes in an effort to eliminate bias; and (3) implemented leadership development, sponsorship and coaching initiatives to engage and develop diverse talent. Another focus of BlackRock’s DEI strategy is to cultivate an inclusive work environment in which employees feel connected to BlackRock’s culture and supported in pursuit of their goals. To this end, BlackRock has committed to raising awareness of racial equity issues and resetting behavioral expectations for employees, as well as to holding firm leaders and managers accountable for continued progress against the firm’s goals.

BlackRock views transparency and accountability as a critical part of its DEI strategy, including as a means to inform, measure and improve its human capital management practices. To that end, in 2020 the firm published its first SASB-aligned disclosure, which includes information regarding workforce diversity that BlackRock plans to update annually. During 2020, it also set goals for increasing the overall workplace representation of Black and Latinx employees and growing the number of female, and US Black and Latinx, leaders (Director and above).  

Board Oversight of Human Capital Management

BlackRock’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) plays an important role in the oversight of human capital management at BlackRock and devotes one full Board meeting annually to an in-depth review of BlackRock’s culture, talent development, retention and recruiting initiatives, DEI strategy, leadership and succession planning and employee feedback. Moreover, year-end business assessments, which include a review of the progress that is being made against the firm’s DEI goals, influence individual compensation outcomes that are reviewed and approved by the Board’s Management Development and Compensation Committee.

Succession planning for BlackRock’s Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives is a key part of the Board’s annual review of human capital management issues. As part of this review, the Board focuses on whether BlackRock has the right people in place to execute the Company’s long-term strategic plans, and on BlackRock’s ability to identify, attract, develop and retain future senior executives. An important element of the succession planning across the organization is a commitment to building leadership from within and increasing diversity in leadership roles.

Employee Engagement

BlackRock prioritizes continuous dialogue with its employees about their experiences at the firm in order to understand employee expectations and assess the efficacy of its human capital management practices. The Company uses several employee feedback mechanisms, including: (i) employee opinion surveys; (ii) interactive townhalls and communications; and (iii) the sponsorship of employee, professional and social impact networks.  These employee engagement mechanisms provide BlackRock with actionable feedback for each team and for BlackRock as a whole.  BlackRock’s employee, professional and social impact networks also provide additional forums and opportunities for employees with diverse backgrounds to connect with one another and shape the firm’s culture. More recently, these networks played an active role in BlackRock’s response to COVID-19, including by instituting programs to combat isolation and more deeply understand the employee experience during the pandemic. The networks, which continue to grow in number, are sponsored by senior leaders and designed by employees, for employees.

Compensation, Wellness and Benefits

BlackRock is committed to responsible business practices and believes that investing in the physical, emotional, mental and financial well-being of its employees is a critical component of the firm’s human capital management strategy. To that end, the Company designs its compensation and benefits practices to: (i) attract and retain employees; (ii) align employee incentives and risk taking with that of the firm’s and the interests of its clients; and (iii) support employees across many aspects of their lives. The Company has a strong pay-for-performance culture and an

11

 

annual compensation process that takes into consideration firmwide results, individual business results and employee performance, as well as market benchmarks. BlackRock also offers a wide range of benefits that it regularly reviews in accordance with industry best practices and the local requirements of its offices, including retirement savings plans, a Flexible Time Off (“FTO”) policy and flexible working arrangements, and parental leave and family support benefits, including fertility benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, and backup elder and childcare benefits. The Company provides comprehensive healthcare and mental-health benefits to eligible employees, including medical, dental and vision coverage, health savings and spending accounts, counseling services, an employee assistance program and access to telemedicine services.

BlackRock prioritizes protecting the rights of its workforce and the equitable treatment of its employees. The Company has implemented policies related to harassment prevention and compliance with equal employment opportunity and overtime regulations. BlackRock is also committed to providing a safe and healthy working environment for its workforce. To do this, it designs global programs, including environmental and occupational health and safety programs, to meet or exceed local requirements. Moreover, BlackRock encourages all of its employees to raise issues of concern and assures employees that they may do so without fear of retaliation.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance of keeping employees safe and healthy and, following its onset, BlackRock implemented several initiatives to support employees. The Company prioritized communication about the telemedicine and digital health resources it makes available, including mental, emotional and physical health offerings. In addition, BlackRock extended cross-border healthcare coverage and support to employees and their dependents temporarily working, or on FTO, outside of their home country as a result of the pandemic.

Training, Innovation and Development

BlackRock is committed to innovation, learning  and reinvention in all areas of its business and believes that developing the capabilities of its employees is integral to delivering long-term value. To that end, the Company’s human capital management practices are designed to provide opportunities for employees to learn, innovate and enhance their skillsets at every stage of their career. These opportunities, which include the firm’s comprehensive online suite of interactive resources and courses (BlackRock Academies), play an important role in engaging BlackRock’s employees.

In addition, BlackRock believes that developing strong leaders is a driver of the firm’s success. Select employees are invited to participate in leadership programs to help accelerate their growth, which include executive coaching, in-person and virtual learning, and senior management sponsorship.

REGULATION

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, and trust and other fiduciary clients of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”). Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and trust banks and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations or bank charters, censures and fines both for individuals and BlackRock.

The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.

GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM

BlackRock’s business may be impacted by numerous regulatory reform initiatives occurring around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes to, or in the enforcement of, existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to alter its business or operating activities and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs) as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing banking, taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) Review

The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has the authority to designate nonbank financial institutions as SIFIs in the United States under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank”). In July 2014, the FSOC pivoted from its previous entity-specific approach to designation and indicated that it would focus on a products and activities-based approach to designation in connection with addressing potential risks in the financial system related to asset management. In December 2019, the FSOC re-affirmed this approach when it voted to change its methodology for assessing financial stability to a products and activities-based approach. This reduces the risk of entity-level designation, however it remains too early to predict the direction of the forthcoming regulatory environment and the FSOC retains the authority to designate an entity if an activities-based approach does not adequately address potential risks. In the event that BlackRock is designated as a SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements and direct supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”).

12

 

Federal Trade Commission Proposal

In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing updates to premerger notification rules enacted under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (“HSR”) that require parties to certain transactions to provide the FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice prior notice and observe a waiting period before consummation of such transactions. The proposals would: (i) require that investors aggregate holdings in an issuer across all associated funds when assessing HSR filing and exemption thresholds and (ii) create a new exemption for acquisitions resulting in aggregate holdings of up to 10% of an issuer, which would be unavailable to investors holding interests of more than 1% in competing firms. If enacted as drafted, the proposal requiring aggregation across associated funds could, absent exemptions for index-funds or certain types of registered funds, substantially increase BlackRock’s pre-merger notification obligations, which may be costly, impair funds’ ability to trade freely, require the implementation of monitoring tools and introduce additional compliance burdens for both BlackRock and the companies in which it invests. In instances where making a pre-merger notification may not be practicable, the proposed changes may serve to limit the size of BlackRock’s aggregate position in certain issuers.

Taxation

BlackRock’s businesses may be directly or indirectly affected by tax legislation and regulation, or the modification of existing tax laws, by US or non-US tax authorities. In the US, legislation at both the federal and state level has been previously proposed to enact a financial transaction tax (“FTT”) on stocks, bonds and a broad range of financial instruments and derivative transactions. In the European Union (“EU”), certain Member States have also enacted similar FTTs and the European Commission (“EC”) has proposed legislation to harmonize these taxes and provide for the adoption of EU-level legislation applicable to some (but not all) EU Member States. If enacted as proposed, FTTs could have an adverse effect on BlackRock’s financial results and clients’ performance results.

The application of tax regulations involves numerous uncertainties and, in the normal course of business, US and non-US tax authorities may review and challenge tax positions adopted by BlackRock. These challenges may result in adjustments to, or impact the timing or amount of, taxable income, deductions or other tax allocations, which may adversely affect BlackRock’s effective tax rate and overall financial condition. Similarly, the Company manages assets in products and accounts that have investment objectives which may conform to tax positions adopted by BlackRock or to specific tax rules. To the extent there are changes in tax law or policy, or regulatory challenges to tax positions adopted by BlackRock, the value or attractiveness of such investments may be diminished and BlackRock may suffer financial or reputational harm.

Regulation of Swaps and Derivatives

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Federal Reserve, the Internal Revenue Service and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review practices and regulations relating to the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives. Such reviews could result in regulations that restrict or limit the use of such products by funds or accounts. If adopted, any such limitations or restrictions could require BlackRock to change certain business practices or implement new compliance processes, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions.

In October 2020, the SEC adopted new regulations governing the use of derivatives by registered investment companies (“RICs”), including mutual funds (other than money market funds), ETFs and closed-end funds, as well as business development companies. RICs will be required to implement and comply with the new rule by the third quarter of 2022. Once implemented, the rule will, among other things, impose limits on the amount of derivatives transactions a RIC can enter into, eliminate the current asset segregation compliance framework and introduce new compliance requirements for funds, including the establishment of comprehensive risk management programs. The rule may impact certain RICs’ usage of derivatives and investment strategy.

Jurisdictions outside the US in which BlackRock operates have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or implementing, more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. For example, various global rules and regulations applicable to the use of financial products by funds, accounts and counterparties that have been adopted or proposed will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the enhanced level of oversight to which it and its clients will be subject. These rules impose requirements such as mandatory central clearing of certain swaps transactions, requiring execution of certain swaps transactions on or through registered electronic trading venues (as opposed to over the phone or other execution methods), reporting transactions to central data repositories, mandating certain documentation standards, requiring the posting and collection of initial and/or variation margin for bilateral swap transactions and subjecting certain types of listed and/or over-the-counter transactions to position limit or position reporting requirements.

In the US, certain interest rate swaps and certain index credit default swaps are subject to Dodd-Frank central clearing and trading venue execution requirements, with additional products and asset classes potentially becoming subject to these requirements in the future. In the EU, central clearing and trading venue requirements for certain swap transactions have become effective for certain types of BlackRock funds and accounts. On March 1, 2017, most derivatives transactions that are not centrally cleared, including non-deliverable foreign exchange forward transactions and currency option transactions, became subject to requirements in the US, EU and numerous other jurisdictions to post or collect mark-to-market margin payments. For certain BlackRock funds and accounts, initial margin requirements may apply in the future in addition to such mark-to-market margin payments. These rules and regulations have the potential to increase the complexity and cost of trading non-cleared derivatives for BlackRock's clients, and may produce regulatory inconsistencies in global derivatives trading rules and increase BlackRock’s operational and legal risks.

Regulation of Exchange-Traded Funds

As part of a focus on financial stability issues and due to the significant growth of this product class over the last few years, regulators globally are examining the implications of an increased presence of ETFs in the markets, including those related to transparency, liquidity and structural resiliency. BlackRock and other sponsors of ETFs are working with market participants and regulators to address certain of these issues but there can be no assurance that structural or regulatory reforms will be implemented in a manner favorable to BlackRock, or at all. Depending on the outcome of this renewed regulatory analysis, or any associated structural reforms, ETF products may become subject to increased

13

 

regulatory scrutiny or restrictions, which may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance and reporting expenses and adversely affect the Company’s business.

Regulation of Money Market Funds

In October 2016, rules were implemented to reform the regulatory structure governing US money market funds to address perceived systemic risks of money market funds. The rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value per share method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of fund assets. Retail money market funds continue operating with a constant net asset value per share. The rules additionally provide for tools for institutional and retail money market funds’ boards designed to address market shocks, including the ability to impose liquidity fees and redemption gates under certain circumstances.

In addition, following market liquidity issues that arose in March 2020 in connection with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory authorities are focused on the need for further regulation for certain money market funds. In December 2020, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued a report outlining ten potential policy measures for consideration to improve the resiliency of money market funds and the broader short-term funding markets. Although it remains too early to accurately predict the forthcoming regulatory environment, including with respect to regulation of money market funds, certain of these reforms, if ever adopted, could significantly impact money market funds and the money market fund industry.

Standards of Conduct Rulemaking

In June 2019, the SEC adopted a package of rulemakings and interpretations addressing investment adviser and broker-dealer standards of conduct. The package includes new rules requiring registered advisers and registered broker-dealers to provide a relationship summary to retail investors, a new rule establishing a standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making recommendations to retail customers and two new interpretations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). These rulemakings and interpretations could increase BlackRock’s disclosure obligations, impact distribution arrangements between BlackRock and its distribution partners, create compliance and operational challenges for BlackRock’s distribution partners and limit BlackRock’s ability to provide certain other services to its clients.

Securities and Exchange Commission Rulemakings for US Registered Funds and Investment Advisers

BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by SEC regulatory initiatives. The SEC and its staff recently have engaged in various initiatives and reviews that seek to improve and modernize the regulatory structure governing the asset management industry, and registered investment companies in particular. These efforts relate to, among other things, embedded leverage through the use of derivatives and other trading practices, cybersecurity, liquidity, enhanced regulatory and public reporting requirements and the evaluation of systemic risks. Over the past year, the SEC has adopted rules that include among other things: (i) a new regulatory framework for fund of funds structures; and (ii) updated eligibility requirements for submitting shareholder proposals under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These rules, and any additional rules or regulatory initiatives resulting from the SEC's efforts, may increase BlackRock’s regulatory compliance requirements as well as disclosure requirements, which could be costly and may impede BlackRock’s growth.

Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Proposed Rulemaking for Registered Investment Advisers

In 2015, the Financial Crime Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“Proposed Rule”) that would extend to a number of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, which are registered or required to be registered as investment advisers with the SEC under the Advisers Act, the requirement to establish written risk-based anti-money laundering programs and report suspicious activity to FinCEN under the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (the “Bank Secrecy Act”). The Proposed Rule would include investment advisers within the Bank Secrecy Act’s definition of “financial institutions”, which would require them to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting and recordkeeping requirements. If adopted in its current form, the Proposed Rule would expose BlackRock to additional compliance costs.

British Exit from the EU

On December 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU, and the UK and EU reverted to being distinct regulatory, legal and customs territories. Although an “EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement” was agreed to in connection with the UK’s departure from the EU, it does not include any substantive provisions with respect to financial services. As a result, from January 1, 2021, cross-border financial services trade between the UK and the EU will be governed by their respective financial services regulations and market access regimes. BlackRock has implemented a number of steps to prepare for this outcome. These steps, which are and have been time consuming and costly and may add complexity to BlackRock’s future European operations, include effecting organizational, governance and operational changes, applying for and receiving additional licenses and permissions in the EU, and engaging in client communications. In addition, depending on how the future relationship between the UK and the EU develops, BlackRock may experience further organizational and operational challenges and incur additional costs in connection with its European operations, particularly with regards to delegation and outsourcing, which may impede the Company’s growth or impact its financial performance.

UK Overseas Funds Regime

As part of its post-EU membership regulatory review, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) is reviewing the requirements it will impose on EU-domiciled funds offered into the UK. Any new requirements could introduce cost and complexity to BlackRock’s cross-border business model.

Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny of Technology Service Providers to Financial Services Firms

There has been growing regulatory scrutiny of technology service providers on which financial services firms are reliant, including the Digital Operational Resilience Act (“DORA”), which was proposed by the EC in September 2020 and focuses on direct regulation of providers and users of technology- and data services. If enacted as proposed, DORA may, among other things: (i) introduce additional governance, risk management, incident reporting, testing and information sharing requirements to a number of BlackRock’s European entities and certain Aladdin clients; and (ii) subject Aladdin to broad additional oversight. Separately, in November 2020, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”)

14

 

released a Consultation on Regulatory and Supervisory Issues Relating to Outsourcing and Third-Party Relationships, which explores direct supervision of technology service providers to financial services firms, in addition to detailing concerns around the potential for systemic risk in the provision of such services.

Reform of Investment Markets

BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory reform initiatives that may affect the Company’s provision of investment services globally. In Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”) governing the provision of investment services has been revised and is accompanied by an associated Regulation (together with certain secondary regulation, “MiFID II”). The Regulation’s requirements generally apply consistently across the EU. The MiFID II reforms, which came into force in January 2018, were substantive, materially changing market transparency requirements, enhancing protections afforded to investors, and increasing operational complexity for the Company. Forthcoming proposals to review the operation of MiFID II and to develop a new EU Retail Investment Strategy may affect the European market structure and impact BlackRock’s ability to operate in European markets. The broad nature of the MiFID II means future reforms could also affect product development, client servicing and distribution models. Similar reforms have been introduced in Switzerland and Australia.

Macroprudential Policies for Asset Managers

Certain policymakers continue to raise long-standing concerns about liquidity and leverage risks in the asset management industry and wider market-based finance sector. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened concerns and prompted a broad review of existing financial market regulations by international standard setters and regulators across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including an assessment of the adequacy of certain structural components of current markets in mitigating risks. In the event that either the longer-standing concerns or recent broad review result in regulatory or policy action, macroprudential tools may begin to apply to open-ended investment funds broadly. BlackRock may also be required to make changes to structural features of certain open-ended investment funds. Either eventuality could limit BlackRock’s ability to offer products to certain clients and/or result in clients altering their investment strategies or allocations in a manner that is adverse to BlackRock.

Revised Capital Requirements for Investment Firms

In December 2017, the EC published a proposal for a new Directive and Regulation on prudential requirements for MiFID investment firms. The proposal passed the EU legislative process and the final texts of the Regulation and Directive were published in December 2019. The new legislative package, which comes into effect in 2021, will result in changes to the amount of regulatory capital BlackRock is required to hold in the EU and how such capital is calculated, as well as introduce revised disclosure obligations for large investment firms. The UK is also proposing the adoption of comparable rules, which will apply to UK-based investment firms from 2022.

EU Market Access

The EC and certain EU Member States have recently advanced a more restrictive approach to the need for a third country (i.e. non-EU country) to obtain “equivalence,” which is the process by which the legal, regulatory, and/or supervisory system in non-EU Member States is recognised by the EC as comparably effective to that in the EU, thereby allowing firms established in such non-EU Member States a degree of access to the EU single market in financial services. In addition, in 2019, the EC commenced a review of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”) to assess, among other things, the conditions for delegating portfolio management mandates to third countries, the effectiveness of regulation on third country fund marketing passports and the continuation of national private placement regimes. To the extent the review results in formal legislation that limits the scope of existing permitted activities and EU market access rights for asset management firms with non-EU operations, or extends more stringent rules to the Directive on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”), BlackRock’s ability to offer collective investment funds and certain investment services to EU-based clients may be adversely affected.

Senior Managers and Certification Regime (“SMCR”)

In the UK, the FCA extended the SMCR to all financial services firms in December 2019. The regime imposes greater accountability and responsibility across the senior management of UK financial services firms by making individuals in impacted firms more accountable for conduct and competence. SMCR impacts nearly all staff of the Company in the UK, and requires extensive documentation to support senior managers and evidence the discharge of their responsibilities.

UK Asset Management Market Study

The FCA has adopted requirements for UK fund managers to assess whether the retail collective investments they manage offer “value” to investors. In 2020, the Company initiated the provision of an annual assessment based upon various factors including cost, performance and comparable services. If “value” has not been provided to consumers, the Company will need to address any identified deficiencies. The FCA also requested that the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) assess the investment consultant and fiduciary markets. The CMA’s final report identified a number of competition issues in such markets and the UK regulatory regime was revised in 2020 to introduce mandatory tendering of investment consultancy and fiduciary management services, and new standards of disclosure of fees and performance. The CMA’s remedies could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to enter into fiduciary and investment management mandates with UK pension fund clients.

Sustainability Regulation

In 2018, EC introduced a number of regulatory proposals to underpin sustainable investment products; require disclosure of sustainability-related information by market participants, investments products, and issuers; and require the integration of sustainability considerations into the investment and risk management processes of asset managers and other institutional investors. Rules arising from the reform proposals will take effect in March 2021. Regulators in Asia have been similarly focused on sustainability reform initiatives. In December 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore finalized its Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management for the asset management industry. The guidelines set forth enhanced environmental risk assessment, monitoring and oversight practices that certain funds registered or licensed in

15

 

Singapore will be required to implement over an 18-month transition period. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission proposed similar enhancements to sustainability risk management practices and disclosure requirements for funds in a Consultation Paper it issued in October 2020.

Securities Financing Transaction Regulation (“SFTR”)

In November 2015, the EU introduced a regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions and total return swaps. The SFTR aims to improve the transparency surrounding securities financing transactions and total return swaps by, among other things, requiring reporting of securities financing transactions to a trade repository and requiring disclosure of the use of securities financing transactions and total return swaps to investors. During 2020, additional obligations became effective under the SFTR that require BlackRock to submit additional transaction reports with substantive details of trading activity to authorities. Compliance with the SFTR may subject BlackRock to additional expenses and could lead to modifications in BlackRock’s securities financing transaction activities.

Central Securities Depository Regulation (“CSDR”)

A settlement discipline regime introduced by the CSDR will become effective in February 2022. The regime includes measures to address settlement failures including rules for trade allocation and confirmation processing, along with cash penalties for failed transactions and mandatory buy-in requirements. To the extent left unchanged by a review that is scheduled to take place during 2021, the regime will require BlackRock to introduce operational mechanisms to facilitate the mandatory buy-in of securities in instances where the seller fails to deliver securities in a timely manner which, if not complied with, may subject BlackRock to penalty.

Cessation of LIBOR

The FCA, which regulates the administrator of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for LIBOR after year-end 2021. As a result, sterling LIBOR and certain other indices which are utilized as benchmarks may no longer be published. The disappearance, or change in the manner of administration, of these benchmarks could result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of and market for any BlackRock investments in instruments and securities linked to such benchmarks. BlackRock may also face operational challenges adopting successor benchmarks.

EXISTING US REGULATION - OVERVIEW

BlackRock and certain of its US subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (“DoL”), the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the FTC, the Department of Justice, the CFTC and other federal government agencies and regulatory bodies.

Certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies. In addition, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. State level regulation through Attorneys General, Insurance Commissioners and other state level agencies also applies to certain BlackRock activities.

The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock and its affiliates. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.

BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Exchange Act, as well as the rules of various securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions, as well as restrictions on BlackRock’s activities and damage to its reputation. Furthermore, Dodd-Frank requires one of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, to register as a municipal advisor (as that term is defined in the Exchange Act) with the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”). The rules subject BTC to additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB.

BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, real estate funds, collective trust funds, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators in this area.

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DoL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients that are subject to ERISA. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require certain BlackRock entities to carry bonds insuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to clients that are not subject to ERISA.

16

 

BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of Dodd-Frank, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. In addition, two of BlackRock’s subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. One of the broker-dealers is also a member of the MSRB and is subject to MSRB rules.

In July 2020, BlackRock’s business activity in California that involves the processing of personal information became subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which provides for enhanced consumer protections for California residents. The CCPA imposes obligations on BlackRock for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for California residents. Any failure by BlackRock to comply with the CCPA may result in fines, heightened regulatory scrutiny and/or reputational harm.

US Banking Regulation

One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a nationally-chartered limited purpose trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as laws and regulations governing capital adequacy, fiduciary activities, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and the prevention of financial crime, including money laundering. BTC is also a member of the Federal Reserve System and is subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC and/or BTC’s customers rather than BlackRock, its affiliates or stockholders.

US Regulation of Securities Financing Transactions

In its 2014 Annual Report, FSOC identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers who act as lending agents as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. The Federal Reserve is also considering whether to impose specific margin or minimum haircut requirements for securities financing transactions.

EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION — OVERVIEW

BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, these operations are also affected by US laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.

Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.

Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and complex regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.

European Regulation

The FCA currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the UK. It is also responsible for the conduct of business regulation of the UK branches of certain of BlackRock’s US subsidiaries. In addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) regulates one BlackRock UK insurance subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and (where relevant) the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services-related business in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”). The FCA’s rules adopted under the FSMA govern the majority of a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business requirements, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to BlackRock’s UK-based insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and theme-based reviews in order to monitor BlackRock’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.

In addition, BlackRock has regulated entities in France, Germany, Ireland, Jersey, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Each of these entities is required to comply with regulatory rules in the country in which it has been established, including the branches of the Netherlands entity which operate across the EU.

BlackRock’s EU-subsidiaries and branches must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID and its accompanying Regulation. BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries must comply with the UK version of MiFID II, which regulates the provision of investment services and activities in the UK. MiFID II, and the UK equivalent of MiFID II, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. The legislation also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity and non-equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock UK subsidiaries must also comply with the UK regulation which implements the Consolidated Life Directive and Insurance Distribution Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms. These include requirements on capital, as well as matters of governance and remuneration. Relevant BlackRock entities must also comply with the requirements of the UCITS Directive and the AIFMD, as implemented in the relevant EU jurisdictions or in the UK, which impose obligations on the authorization and capital, conduct of business, organization, transparency and marketing of retail and alternative investment funds respectively that are sold in, or marketed to, the EU. The obligations introduced through these regulations and directives will affect certain of BlackRock’s European operations. Compliance with the UCITS Directives and the AIFMD may subject BlackRock to additional expenses associated with depositary oversight and other organizational requirements.

 

17

 

BlackRock’s European-regulated subsidiaries are also subject to the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (or the UK equivalent regulation in the case of BlackRock’s UK-regulated subsidiaries), an EU regulation governing derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which requires (i) the central clearing of certain over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives; (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives (including the exchange of collateral with certain counterparties); and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts to an European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) registered or recognized derivatives trade repository (or a UK authorized trade repository in the case of the UK version of EMIR).

The EU has seen an increase in Common Supervisory Actions by ESMA to coordinate supervisory action by national EU regulators, most notably in areas such as product governance, liquidity management and fund costs and charges. BlackRock’s European operations may be affected to the extent this initiative results in formal legislation or action.  

EU Member States and many other non-US jurisdictions have adopted statutes and/or regulations concerning privacy and data protection and requiring notification of data breaches. For example, in May 2018, the EU Data Protection Directive was replaced by a more extensive General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). In addition, the UK incorporated GDPR into an equivalent UK law (“UK GDPR”) that became effective when it left the EU on January 1, 2021. GDPR and UK GDPR, as well as other statutes and/or regulations concerning data privacy and security, increase compliance obligations, affect BlackRock’s collection, processing and retention of personal data and reporting of data breaches, and provide for increased penalties for non-compliance.

Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region

In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (“FIEA”) and the Act on Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fines, cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEA. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activities which subjects it to the regulations set forth in the Real Estate Brokerage Act.  

In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws, and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services activities in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection.

The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (“SFO”), which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector.

BlackRock has obtained the approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for setting up a Fund Management Company (“FMC”) and approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission for setting up a Wealth Management Joint Venture Company (“WMC”) with Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd and China Construction Bank Corp in China. BlackRock is preparing for the next stages of the regulatory license applications process prior to being issued with final regulatory approvals and the launch of its first investment products for both the FMC and WMC.

Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches and representative offices across the Asia-Pacific region, including in Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in all of these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant, suspend or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.

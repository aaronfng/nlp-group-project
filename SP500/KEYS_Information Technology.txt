For certain verticals such as network monitoring and performance management, our go-to-market solution strategy is based on strategic relationships with technical partners to provide the customer with a complete solution. In these cases, we work with technical partners in two main ways: (i) through customer referrals and recommendations and (ii) through automation integration/interoperability that provides a differentiated solution for our customers.
Manufacturing
To maximize our productivity and our ability to respond to market conditions, we have significant in-house manufacturing capabilities that are supplemented by contract manufacturers. Our in-house manufacturing efforts are focused on the highest value added, more complex and highly technical aspects of production, and we use contract manufacturers for assembly, printed circuit board production, metal die-casting and plastic moulding. Our largest manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia focuses on the final assembly of our most sophisticated instruments and on final tuning, calibration and test of instruments across the broader portfolio. We also operate three technology centers in Santa Rosa, California; Colorado Springs, Colorado; and Boeblingen, Germany that collectively provide key components and sub‑systems for our instruments, including microwave monolithic integrated circuits, thick and thin film circuits, optical components, high-speed probes and precision machining. Our technology centers provide a competitive advantage by developing and manufacturing differentiated technology components with performance levels that are not available commercially.
We have manufacturing facilities in California and Colorado in the United States. Outside of the United States, we have manufacturing centralized in Malaysia along with other manufacturing facilities, including in Germany and Japan.
We generally manufacture products after we have received firm orders for delivery.
Marketing
We have several ongoing programs to support the sale and distribution of our solutions and to inform existing and potential customers, partners and distributors about the capabilities and benefits of our expansive solutions and services portfolio. We are modernizing our marketing platforms to increase focus on lead generation for top growth segments. We continue to invest in improving Keysight brand recognition in strategic industries, such as automotive and commercial communications, and geographies, including the greater San Francisco area, Germany, Shanghai and Nagoya. Our marketing efforts promote the Keysight business through participating in industry trade shows and technical conferences, sponsoring technical seminars and webinars that highlight our solutions, and advertising in digital media publications and physical locations. Additionally, we write and distribute various forms of marketing collateral including brochures, white papers, application notes, solutions briefs and articles for online and print journals. Finally, we communicate to our existing and potential customers through our corporate website and various social media outlets, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and our corporate blog.
Human Capital
We have a diverse, inclusive and respectful work environment, where employees enjoy challenging assignments, development opportunities, competitive salaries, and a safe workplace. As of October 31, 2020, we had approximately 13,900 employees worldwide representing more than 80 self-identified nationalities working across approximately 30 countries.
The Chief People and Administrative Officer ("CAO") is responsible for developing and executing the company’s human capital strategy. This includes directing Keysight's global policies and programs for leadership and talent development, compensation, benefits, staffing and workforce planning, human resources systems, education and organization development, workplace strategies, and global sourcing and indirect procurement, and ensuring effective and efficient internal company operations. The CAO is responsible for developing and integrating the company’s diversity and inclusion priorities and strategy. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and CAO regularly update our board of directors and the Compensation Committee on human capital matters.
Culture, Values and Standards
Our core values and culture reflect a commitment to ethical business practices and outstanding corporate citizenship wherever we operate in the world. We adhere to the tenets of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and core International Labor Organization Conventions, and we comply with the labor and employment laws of all countries in which we operate, prioritizing fair employment practices, labor compliance, nondiscrimination and equal employment opportunity. We are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance, which further strengthens our efforts and commitment. KLM provides the framework to enable us to execute on our strategies with our customers, stockholders and employees while demonstrating our values of Speed and Courage, Uncompromising Integrity, High Performance, Social Responsibility and One Keysight.
Our values make our culture dynamic, inspiring, and powerful and draw on our employees’ skills and aspirations. Our culture fosters employee engagement and innovation, which we believe is a competitive advantage. These values and practices allow us

to maintain a best-in-class work environment, where all employees are responsible for upholding our values. Our Keysight Standards of Business Conduct ("SBC") governs our dealings with our customers, competitors, suppliers, third-party partners, as well as with our fellow employees, and is readily available for review. SBC training is required annually for all our employees. Additionally, our Open Door Policy reflects our values by creating a safe and trusting environment where employees have direct access to any level of management to discuss ideas and concerns in a constructive manner.
Hiring, Diversity and Equal Employment Policy
We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment. Employees are treated with dignity and respect in an environment free from harassment and discrimination regardless of race, color, age, gender, disability, minority, sexual orientation or any other protected class. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion helps us attract and retain the best talent, enables employees to realize their full potential, and drives high performance through innovation and collaboration. Because we know that diversity is truly a competitive advantage that helps drive innovation, we strive to maintain a best-in-class work environment that fosters respect for individuals, their ideas and contributions. We benefit from the innovation that results when people with differing experiences, perspectives and cultures work together. Our staffing policies, which extend across every phase of the recruitment process, underscore our commitment to diversity, ethics, integrity and compliance everywhere we do business. We have partnerships with universities worldwide that are aligned with our strategic talent needs, including Historically Black Colleges and Universities ("HBCU") in the United States. Inclusion and diversity are among our CEO’s top priorities, with clearly outlined near-term actions to accelerate progress specifically for under-represented minorities in addition to our broader inclusion and diversity program initiatives.
Our three-year average employee turnover rate was approximately 6 percent and has been lower than the industry average for the past five years. We have a global job acceptance rate of over 90 percent over the past three years, and we have approximately doubled the number of our software engineers since 2014.
Learning and Development
We believe that learning is a lifelong pursuit that creates a mindset of professional growth and continuous improvement. We emphasize experimentation, stretch assignments and on-the job learning and development. Our employees have access to a wide range of programs, workshops, classes and resources to help them excel in their careers and share what they know with others. Our Keysight University platform offers robust training and development programs, as well as learning resources. Our Employee Educational Assistance Program provides financial and management support to eligible employees, allowing them to pursue academic degrees related to their field of work. Employees may also participate in a tuition reimbursement program and distance learning degree programs with major universities.
Many of our employees are required to take annual training courses related to their work, including those pertaining to the environment, data privacy, and workplace health and safety. We also have leadership development programs available to employees, including the New Manager Training Program, Manager’s Boot Camp, and Executive Online Development Program.
We hold an annual Keysight Executive Development ("KED") program with senior business leaders to weave our values with strategic business objectives, mission, and vision, and align on strategy and key focus areas for the company. These recorded sessions and the calls to action are then cascaded down to all Keysight employees. Our Keysight Leadership Model was created from one of such annual programs, and over 11,000 Keysight employees have completed customized Keysight Leadership Model training.
Compensation and Benefits
We compensate employees with competitive wages and benefit programs designed to meet employee needs. Our compensation and benefit programs are designed to recognize our employees' contributions to value creation and business results, including competitive base salaries and variable pay, which rewards company and individual performance; share-based equity award grants; health and welfare benefits; time-off; development programs and training; and opportunities to give back to our communities through donations of time and money.
Health and Safety
Keysight maintains a best-in-class work environment and provides a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. We accomplish this through strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety, including recognition and control of workplace hazards, tracking injury and illness rates, utilizing a global travel health program, and maintaining robust emergency and disaster recovery plans.

Backlog
Backlog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers and/or completion of a commitment to a customer. At October 31, 2020, our unfilled backlog was approximately $1,709 million, as compared to approximately $1,380 million at October 31, 2019. Consistent with our strategy, we are seeing an increase in solution sales, which have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle; however, we expect that the majority of unfilled backlog will be recognized as revenue within six months. While backlog on any particular date can be an indicator of short-term revenue performance, it is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.
Intellectual Property
We generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. Although we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material, other than the Keysight mark.
Materials
Our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials, such as plastic resins and sheet metal. We purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address the potential disruption in, and other risks related to, our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of solutions for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain. For a further discussion of risks related to the materials and components required for our operations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Government Regulations
Our company is subject to various federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and solutions, and it is our policy to comply with the laws in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Regulations include but are not limited to those related to environment, corruption, bribery, import and export controls, competition, product safety, workplace health and safety, employment, labor and data privacy. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about the risks related to government regulations, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Environmental Regulations
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated, and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur additional costs in the future.
Some of our properties are undergoing remediation by HP Inc. ("HP") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of Agilent’s separation from HP in 1999. In connection with Agilent’s separation from HP, HP and Agilent entered into an agreement pursuant to which HP agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Agilent with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. Agilent has assigned its rights and obligations under this agreement to Keysight in respect of facilities transferred to Keysight in our separation from Agilent on November 1, 2014 (the "Separation"). As a result, HP has access to a limited number of our properties to perform remediation. Although HP agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at such properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. In connection with the Separation, Agilent will indemnify us directly for any liabilities related thereto. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its remediation obligations or that Agilent will continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations.

In connection with the Separation, Agilent also agreed to indemnify us for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred from Agilent to us. We cannot be sure that Agilent will fulfill its indemnification obligations.
We maintain a comprehensive environmental site liability insurance policy that may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.
Import/Export Regulations
We sell products and solutions to customers all over the world and are required to comply with U.S Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions programs limiting or banning sales into certain countries. Countries outside of the U.S. have implemented similar controls and sanction regulations. Together these controls and regulations may impose licensing requirements on exports of certain technology and software from the U.S. and may impact our ability to transact business in certain countries or with certain customers. We have developed compliance programs and training to prevent violations of these programs and regulations, and we regularly monitor changes in the law and regulations and create strategies to deal with changes. Changes in the law may restrict or further restrict our ability to sell products and solutions.
Anti-Corruption Regulations
Because we have extensive international operations, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. We have compliance policies, programs and training to prevent non-compliance with such anti-corruption regulations in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory changes that may impact our business and develop strategies to address the changes and incorporate them into existing compliance programs.
Data Privacy Regulations
With extensive operations all over the world, we must comply with complex regulations governing data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union and data privacy regulations in other jurisdictions. These regulations require careful handling of internal data. We have internal data handling policies and practices to comply with global data privacy requirements, including GDPR and similar regulations and devote resources to keep up with changing data privacy regulations. The risk of data privacy breaches cannot be entirely eliminated, creating risk of fines and penalties. Additionally, new laws, amendments, or interpretations of regulations, industry standards, and contractual obligations relating to data privacy may require us to incur additional costs related to compliance and may restrict our business operations.

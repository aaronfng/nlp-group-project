Item 1. Business.
Overview
Zoetis Inc. is a global leader in the animal health industry, focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, vaccines, diagnostic products, biodevices, genetic tests and precision livestock farming technology. We have a diversified business, commercializing products across eight core species: dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals) and cattle, swine, poultry, fish and sheep (collectively, livestock); and within seven major product categories: vaccines, anti-infectives, parasiticides, dermatology, other pharmaceutical products, medicated feed additives and animal health diagnostics. For more than 65 years, we have been committed to advancing the health of animals and bringing solutions to our customers who raise and care for them.

Operating Segments
The animal health medicines, vaccines and diagnostics market is characterized by meaningful differences in customer needs across different regions. This is due to a variety of factors, including:
•economic differences, such as standards of living in developed markets as compared to emerging markets;
•cultural differences, such as dietary preferences for different animal proteins, pet ownership preferences and pet care standards;
•epidemiological differences, such as the prevalence of certain bacterial and viral strains and disease dynamics;
•treatment differences, such as utilization of different types of medicines and vaccines, as well as the pace of adoption of new technologies;
•environmental differences, such as seasonality, climate and the availability of arable land and fresh water; and
•regulatory differences, such as standards for product approval and manufacturing.
As a result of these differences, among other things, we organize and operate our business in two segments:
•United States (U.S.) with revenue of $3,557 million, or 53% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020; and
•International with revenue of $3,035 million, or 46% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Within each of these operating segments, we offer a diversified product portfolio for both companion animal and livestock customers so that we can capitalize on local trends and customer needs.
In addition, our Client Supply Services (CSS) organization which provides contract manufacturing services to third parties, and our human health products, together represented approximately 1% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

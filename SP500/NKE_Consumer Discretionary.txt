GENERAL
NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “NIKE” and the “Company” refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise. Our NIKE digital commerce website is located at www.nike.com. On our NIKE corporate website, located at investors.nike.com, we post the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our definitive Proxy Statements are also posted on our corporate website. All such filings on our corporate website are available free of charge. Copies of these filings are also available on the SEC's website (www.sec.gov). Also available on our corporate website are the charters of the committees of our Board of Directors, as well as our corporate governance guidelines and code of ethics; copies of any of these documents will be provided in print to any shareholder who submits a request in writing to NIKE Investor Relations, One Bowerman Drive, Beaverton, Oregon 97005-6453.
Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products directly to consumers through NIKE-owned retail stores and digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations) and to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer experiences through our digital platforms. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the United States, while equipment products are produced both in the United States and abroad.
PRODUCTS
We focus our NIKE Brand product offerings in six key categories: Running, NIKE Basketball, the Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear (our sports-inspired lifestyle products). We also market products designed for kids, as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as American football, baseball, cricket, golf, lacrosse, skateboarding, tennis, volleyball, walking, wrestling and other outdoor activities.
NIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products. Sportswear, the Jordan Brand and Running are currently our top-selling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales.
We also sell sports apparel covering the above-mentioned categories, which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use and also demonstrates our commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. Sportswear, Training and Running are currently our top-selling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos.
We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.
Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.
Our wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.

In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.
SALES AND MARKETING
We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, operating and logistics-related factors, as evidenced by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as well as changing design trends, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America (APLA), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. The Hurley brand results, prior to its divestiture in the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2020, are included in North America. Sales through our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.
Converse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.
UNITED STATES MARKET
For fiscal 2020, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 39% of total revenues, compared to 41% and 42% for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. We sell our NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand and Converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During fiscal 2020, our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 24% of sales in the United States.
Our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand and Converse products to consumers through various digital platforms. In addition, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the United States:

One distribution center for Converse is located in Ontario, California, which is leased. There are other smaller distribution facilities located in various parts of the United States, some of which are leased or operated by third-parties.
INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
For fiscal 2020, non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for approximately 61% of total revenues, compared to 59% and 58% for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, respectively. We sell our products to retail accounts, through our own NIKE Direct operations and through a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 74 distribution centers outside of the United States. During fiscal 2020, NIKE's three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 15% of total non-U.S. sales.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER
No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net Revenues during fiscal 2020.
PRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
We believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while reducing waste.
In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts who consult with us and review designs, materials, concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and development process.
As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of NIKE Air, Zoom, Free, Flywire, Dri-Fit, Flyknit, Flyweave, FlyEase, ZoomX, React and Adaptive technologies, among others, throughout our Running, NIKE Basketball, Jordan Brand, Football (Soccer), Training and Sportswear categories, as well as Converse, typifies our dedication to designing innovative products.
MANUFACTURING
We are supplied by 122 footwear factories located in 12 countries. Virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the United States by over 15 independent contract manufacturers, which often operate multiple factories. The largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal 2020 NIKE Brand footwear production. For fiscal 2020, contract factories in Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured approximately 50%, 24% and 22% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively. We also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in Argentina and India to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries. For fiscal 2020, four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 61% of NIKE Brand footwear production.
We are supplied by 329 apparel factories located in 38 countries. The largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 11% of total fiscal 2020 NIKE Brand apparel production. Virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the United States by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories. For fiscal 2020, contract factories in Vietnam, China and Cambodia produced approximately 28%, 23% and 12% of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2020, two apparel contract manufacturers accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 48% of NIKE Brand apparel production.
The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester and canvas, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2020, Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon, in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as independent contractors in China and


2020 FORM 10-K 3


Table of Contents


Vietnam, were our suppliers of materials and cushioning components used in footwear. Air Manufacturing Innovation also manufactures and sells small amounts of various other plastic products to other manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware. NIKE's independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place. NIKE's independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products.
Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America (“Sojitz America”), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed import-export financing services for us. During fiscal 2020, Sojitz America provided financing and purchasing services for NIKE Brand products sold in certain NIKE markets including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, India, South Africa and Uruguay, excluding products produced and sold in the same country. Approximately 4% of NIKE Brand sales occurred in those countries. Any failure of Sojitz America to provide these services or any failure of Sojitz America's banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets. Such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability. However, we believe that any such disruption would be short-term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE
Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. We have not, to date, been materially affected by any such risk, but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.
In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.
We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including new and potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods, may negatively affect U.S. corporations with production activities outside the U.S., including NIKE. There have also been discussions and commentary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods, which could negatively affect U.S. corporations with business operations and/or consumer markets in those countries. Depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the U.S. government and the manner in which foreign governments respond to such reforms, it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting China, which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us, we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers China's domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community.
Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe that we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.
Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or "FCPA", and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. We source a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United States, and we have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners.
COMPETITION
The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment, including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment, constitute significant risk factors in our operations.

Table of Contents


NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are:
	
•
	
Product attributes such as quality; performance and reliability; new product style, design, innovation and development, as well as consumer price/value.
	
•
	
Consumer connection, engagement and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing, promotion and digital experiences; social media interaction; customer support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, influencers, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.
	
•
	
Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and on digital platforms.
We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas.
TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS
We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We strategically pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against third-party theft and infringement.
We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we use in marketing our products. We own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have sought and obtained trademark registrations.
We have copyright protection in our design, graphics and other original works. When appropriate, we also obtain registered copyrights.
We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components, technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features, functionality, and industrial and aesthetic designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel, athletic equipment and digital devices and related software applications. These patents expire at various times.
We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported by our intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, patents and trade secrets, among others.
We have followed a policy of applying for and registering intellectual property rights in the United States and select foreign countries on trademarks, inventions, innovations and designs that we deem valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against third-party infringement.
EMPLOYEES
As of May 31, 2020, we had approximately 75,400 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. Management is committed to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential. None of our employees are represented by a union, except for certain employees in the APLA geography, where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain Company decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into and/or comply with industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements.

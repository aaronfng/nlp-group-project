Electric Utility Generation and Supply Mix: During 2020, Consumers announced a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. This goal includes not only emissions from Consumers’ owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market.
Consumers expects to reduce carbon emissions of its owned generation by more than 90 percent from its 2005 levels by 2040 through execution of its Clean Energy Plan, which calls for replacing its coal-fueled generation predominantly with investment in renewable energy. The remaining emissions will be offset through alternative measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, landfill methane emission capture, and large-scale tree planting. Specifically, the Clean Energy Plan provides for the retirement of the D.E. Karn 1 & 2 coal-fueled generating units in 2023 and the potential retirement of the J.H. Campbell 1 & 2 coal-fueled generating units in 2031 or earlier.

1Represents Consumers’ share of net pumped-storage generation. During 2020, the pumped-storage facility consumed 1,369 GWh of electricity to pump water during off-peak hours for storage in order to generate 998 GWh of electricity later during peak-demand hours.
2Represents purchases under long-term PPAs.
3Represents purchases from the MISO energy market.
During 2020, Consumers acquired 57 percent of the electricity it provided to customers through long-term PPAs and the MISO energy market. Consumers offers its generation into the MISO energy market on a day-ahead and real-time basis and bids for power in the market to serve the demand of its customers. Consumers is a net purchaser of power and supplements its generation capability with purchases from the MISO energy market to meet its customers’ needs during peak-demand periods.
At December 31, 2020, Consumers had future commitments to purchase capacity and energy under long-term PPAs with various generating plants. These contracts require monthly capacity payments based on the plants’ availability or deliverability. The payments for 2021 through 2040 are estimated to total $9.0 billion and, for each of the next five years, range from $0.7 billion to $1.1 billion annually. These amounts may vary depending on plant availability and fuel costs. For further information about Consumers’ future capacity and energy purchase obligations, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Contractual Obligations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments—Contractual Commitments.
During 2020, 23 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its coal-fueled generating units, which burned five million tons of coal and produced a combined total of 7,960 GWh of electricity. In order to obtain the coal it needs, Consumers enters into physical coal supply contracts.
21
Table of Contents
At December 31, 2020, Consumers had future commitments to purchase coal through 2022; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $88 million. Most of Consumers’ rail-supplied coal contracts have fixed prices, although some contain market-based pricing. Consumers’ vessel-supplied coal contracts have fixed base prices that are adjusted monthly to reflect changes to the fuel cost of vessel transportation. At December 31, 2020, Consumers had 76 percent of its 2021 expected coal requirements under contract, as well as a 54-day supply of coal on hand.
In conjunction with its coal supply contracts, Consumers leases a fleet of railcars and has transportation contracts with various companies to provide rail and vessel services for delivery of purchased coal to Consumers’ generating facilities. Consumers’ coal transportation contracts are future commitments and expire on various dates through 2025; payment obligations under these contracts totaled $718 million at December 31, 2020.
During 2020, 17 percent of the energy Consumers provided to customers was generated by its natural gas‑fueled generating units, which burned 43 bcf of natural gas and produced a combined total of 5,883 GWh of electricity.
In order to obtain the gas it needs for electric generation fuel, Consumers’ electric utility purchases gas from the market near the time of consumption, at prices that allow it to compete in the electric wholesale market. For units 3 & 4 of D.E. Karn and for the Jackson and Zeeland plants, Consumers utilizes an agent that owns firm transportation rights to each plant to purchase gas from the market and transport the gas to the facilities.
Electric Utility Competition: Consumers’ electric utility business is subject to actual and potential competition from many sources, in both the wholesale and retail markets, as well as in electric generation, electric delivery, and retail services.
Michigan law allows electric customers in Consumers’ service territory to buy electric generation service from alternative electric suppliers in an aggregate amount capped at ten percent of Consumers’ sales, with certain exceptions. At December 31, 2020, electric deliveries under the ROA program were at the ten‑percent limit. Of Consumers’ 1.9 million electric customers, fewer than 300, or 0.02 percent, purchased electric generation service under the ROA program. For additional information, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook—Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties.
Consumers also faces competition or potential competition associated with industrial customers relocating all or a portion of their production capacity outside of Consumers’ service territory for economic reasons; municipalities owning or operating competing electric delivery systems; and customer self-generation. Consumers addresses this competition in various ways, including:
•aggressively controlling operating, maintenance, and fuel costs and passing savings on to customers
•providing renewable energy options and energy waste reduction programs
•providing competitive rate-design options, particularly for large energy-intensive customers
•offering tariff-based incentives that support economic development
•monitoring activity in adjacent geographical areas

Consumers’ gas utility customer base consists of a mix of primarily residential, commercial, and diversified industrial customers in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula.
Presented in the following illustration is Consumers’ 2020 gas utility operating revenue of $1.8 billion by customer class:
cms-20201231_g4.jpg
Consumers’ gas utility operations are not dependent on a single customer, or even a few customers, and the loss of any one or even a few of Consumers’ largest customers is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Consumers’ financial condition.
In 2020, deliveries of natural gas through Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, including off-system transportation deliveries, totaled 360 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 36 bcf. In 2019, deliveries of natural gas through Consumers’ pipeline and distribution network, including off-system transportation deliveries, totaled 391 bcf, which included GCC deliveries of 41 bcf. Consumers’ gas utility operations are seasonal. The consumption of natural gas typically increases in the winter, due primarily to colder temperatures and the resulting use of natural gas as heating fuel. Consumers injects natural gas into storage during the summer months for use during the winter months. During 2020, 43 percent of the natural gas supplied to all customers during the winter months was supplied from storage.

Table of Contents
Gas Utility Supply: In 2020, Consumers purchased 84 percent of the gas it delivered from U.S. suppliers. The remaining 16 percent was purchased from authorized GCC suppliers and delivered by Consumers to customers in the GCC program. Presented in the following illustration are the supply arrangements for the gas Consumers delivered to GCC and GCR customers during 2020:
cms-20201231_g6.jpg
Firm gas transportation or firm city-gate contracts are those that define a fixed amount, price, and delivery time frame. Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts are with Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company and Trunkline Gas Company, LLC, each a non‑affiliated company. Under these contracts, Consumers purchases and transports gas to Michigan for ultimate delivery to its customers. Consumers’ firm gas transportation contracts expire on various dates through 2023 and provide for the delivery of 31 percent of Consumers’ total gas supply requirements in 2021. Consumers purchases the balance of its required gas supply under firm city-gate contracts and through authorized suppliers under the GCC program.
Gas Utility Competition: Competition exists in various aspects of Consumers’ gas utility business. Competition comes from GCC and from alternative fuels and energy sources, such as propane, oil, and electricity.

CMS Energy and Consumers Environmental Strategy and Compliance
CMS Energy and Consumers are committed to protecting the environment; this commitment extends beyond compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In February 2020, Consumers announced a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions from its electric business by 2040. This goal includes not only emissions from Consumers’ owned generation, but also emissions from the generation of power purchased through long-term PPAs and from the MISO energy market.
Consumers expects to reduce carbon emissions of its owned generation by more than 90 percent from its 2005 levels by 2040 through execution of its Clean Energy Plan, which calls for replacing its coal-fueled generation predominantly with investment in renewable energy. The remaining emissions will be offset through alternative measures including, but not limited to, carbon sequestration, landfill methane emission capture, and large-scale tree planting. During 2020, Consumers provided 11 percent of its electricity (self-generated and purchased) from renewable sources. Additionally, Consumers began operation of Gratiot Farms Wind Project, a 150-MW wind generation project, in December 2020 and expects to take full ownership and begin commercial operation of another with capacity of up to 166 MW in early 2021. Furthermore, Consumers has executed agreements to purchase another wind generation project under development, with capacity of up to 201 MW, and a solar generating facility under development, with capacity of up to 150 MW. For each of these projects, Consumers expects to take full ownership and begin commercial operation of the project in 2022.
In addition to Consumers’ efforts to reduce the electric utility’s carbon footprint, it is also making efforts to reduce the gas utility’s methane footprint. In 2019, Consumers released its Methane Reduction Plan, which set a goal of net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas delivery system by 2030. Consumers plans to reduce methane emissions from its system by about 80 percent by accelerating the replacement of aging pipe, rehabilitating or retiring outdated infrastructure, and adopting new technologies and practices. The remaining emissions will be offset by purchasing and/or producing renewable natural gas.
CMS Energy, Consumers, and their subsidiaries are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental regulations for air and water quality, solid waste management, and other matters. Consumers expects to recover costs to comply with environmental regulations in customer rates, but cannot guarantee this result. For additional information concerning environmental matters, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 4, Contingencies and Commitments.

Solid Waste Disposal: Costs related to the construction, operation, corrective action, and closure of solid waste disposal facilities for coal ash are significant. Consumers’ coal ash disposal areas are regulated under Michigan’s solid waste rules and by the EPA’s rules regulating CCRs. To address some of the requirements of these rules, Consumers has converted all of its fly ash handling systems to dry systems. In addition, Consumers’ ash facilities have programs designed to protect the environment and are subject to quarterly EGLE inspections. Consumers’ estimate of capital and cost of removal expenditures to comply with regulations relating to ash disposal is $156 million from 2021 through 2025.
Water: Consumers uses substantial amounts of water to operate and cool its electric generating plants and gas compression stations. Water discharge quality is regulated and administered by EGLE under the federal NPDES program. To comply with such regulation, Consumers’ facilities have discharge monitoring programs. The EPA issued final regulations for wastewater discharges from electric generating plants in 2015 and amended them in 2017 and 2020. Consumers’ estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations as presently promulgated is $23 million from 2021 through 2025.
In 2014, the EPA finalized its cooling water intake rule for electric generating units, which requires Consumers to evaluate the biological impact of its cooling water intake systems and ensure that it is using the best technology available to minimize adverse environmental impacts. Consumers’ estimate of capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $38 million from 2021 through 2025.
Air: Consumers is subject to federal and state environmental regulations that require extensive reductions in nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxides, particulate matter, and mercury emissions. To comply with these regulations, Consumers has invested in emissions control equipment at its electric generating plants. Consumers’ estimate of ongoing capital expenditures to comply with these regulations is $43 million from 2021 through 2025.
Consumers’ future costs to comply with solid waste disposal, water, and air environmental regulations may vary depending on future legislation, litigation, executive orders, treaties, or rulemaking.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Outlook—Consumers Electric Utility Outlook and Uncertainties—Electric Environmental Outlook.
Insurance
CMS Energy and its subsidiaries, including Consumers, maintain insurance coverage generally similar to comparable companies in the same lines of business. The insurance policies are subject to terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions that might not fully compensate CMS Energy or Consumers for all losses. A portion of each loss is generally assumed by CMS Energy or Consumers in the form of deductibles and self-insured retentions that, in some cases, are substantial. As CMS Energy or Consumers renews its policies, it is possible that some of the present insurance coverage may not be renewed or obtainable on commercially reasonable terms due to restrictive insurance markets.

Within the utility industry, there is strong competition for rare, high-demand talent, including those related to renewable energy generation, technology, and data analytics. In order to address this competition and to be able to meet its human capital needs, CMS Energy and Consumers provide compensation and benefits that are competitive with industry peers. Furthermore, the companies have developed a comprehensive talent strategy, the Talent Roadmap, to attract, develop, and retain highly skilled employees. The strategy focuses on three areas, which are summarized below.
•Cultivating a Purpose-Driven Culture: This goal is aimed at ensuring all co-workers understand how their work drives the companies’ key strategic goals. The companies’ progress toward a purpose-driven culture is measured through an engagement index and an empowerment index developed from data obtained through an annual employee engagement survey of union and non-union co-workers administered by a third party. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the employee engagement index score was 83 percent, which ranked in the first quartile of U.S. utilities. The employee empowerment index score, which measures the percentage of employees that feel the workplace promotes empowerment, was 63 percent. Each employee empowerment question was individually benchmarked and ranked in the second quartile of high-performing companies. The high-performing benchmark was created by the third party who administered the survey through a targeted sampling of working adults within the U.S. who work for firms with widely respected reputations. CMS Energy and Consumers have a goal to achieve a first-quartile score by 2024.
•Creating a Breakthrough Employee Experience: A breakthrough employee experience is one that instills pride and ownership in one’s work. To measure progress toward a breakthrough employee experience, the companies measure employees’ satisfaction with people processes, such as performance management and hiring and onboarding new employees. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the employee experience index was 52 percent; the companies have a goal to achieve a score of 80 percent within the next ten years.
•Building Skill Sets at Scale: With an overarching goal of ensuring employees have the right skills to succeed, the companies measure progress in this area through achievement of workforce planning and hiring milestones and through a first-time skill attainment index to evaluate the effectiveness of training. The companies develop skill sets in co-workers through a variety of means, including union apprenticeship programs and yearly trainings for newly required skills. In 2021, the companies will launch a full-scale development program for leaders to enable robust succession planning and improve employee engagement and empowerment.
This talent strategy allows CMS Energy and Consumers to shape employees’ experience and enable leaders to coach and develop co-workers, source talent, and anticipate and adjust to changing skill sets in the business environment.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
As a part of the companies’ Talent Roadmap, CMS Energy and Consumers also employ a comprehensive diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy designed to embed diversity, equity, and inclusion into all aspects of their business. This is done through embedding standards for diversity, equity, and inclusion into all company processes and ensuring these standards are incorporated into all employee experiences. To measure their success, the companies utilize select questions in the annual engagement survey to create a diversity, equity, and inclusion index. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the diversity, equity, and inclusion index score was 76 percent; the companies have a goal to achieve a score of 78 percent in 2021.
Co-workers are also empowered to engage in employee resource groups and events that encourage candid conversations around diversity, equity, and inclusion. There are seven employee resource groups available to all co-workers; these groups are, by date of origin:

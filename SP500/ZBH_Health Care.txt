Business

Overview

Zimmer Biomet is a global leader in musculoskeletal healthcare.  We design, manufacture and market orthopedic reconstructive products; sports medicine, biologics, extremities and trauma products; office based technologies; spine, craniomaxillofacial and thoracic (“CMFT”) products; dental implants; and related surgical products.  We collaborate with healthcare professionals around the globe to advance the pace of innovation.  Our products and solutions help treat patients suffering from disorders of, or injuries to, bones, joints or supporting soft tissues.  Together with healthcare professionals, we help millions of people live better lives.  In this report, “Zimmer Biomet,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  “Zimmer Biomet Holdings” refers to the parent company only.  

Zimmer Biomet Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001.  Our history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing Company, a predecessor, was founded in Warsaw, Indiana.  On August 6, 2001, we were spun off from our former parent and became an independent public company.  In 2015, we acquired LVB Acquisition, Inc. (“LVB”), the parent company of Biomet, Inc. (“Biomet”), and LVB and Biomet became our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  In connection with the merger, we changed our name from Zimmer Holdings, Inc. to Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.

Customers, Sales and Marketing

Our primary customers include orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, and other specialists, dentists, hospitals, stocking distributors, healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups.  These customers range from large multinational enterprises to independent clinicians and dentists.  

We market and sell products through three principal channels:  1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, referred to as direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental practices and dental laboratories.  With direct channel accounts and some healthcare dealers, inventory is generally consigned to sales agents or customers.  With sales to stocking distributors, some healthcare dealers and hospitals, dental practices and dental laboratories, title to product passes upon shipment.  Consignment sales represented approximately 80 percent of our net sales in 2020.  No individual customer accounted for more than 1 percent of our net sales for 2020.

We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title to consigned inventory in an effort to have sufficient quantities available when products are needed for surgical procedures.  Safety stock levels are determined based on a number of factors, including demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to maintain service levels.  

We also carry trade accounts receivable balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent with local market practices.

We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and support personnel, some of whom are employed or contracted by independent distributors and sales agencies.  We invest a significant amount of time and expense in training sales associates in how to use specific products and how to best inform surgeons of product features and uses.  Sales force representatives must have strong technical selling skills and medical education to provide technical support for surgeons.

In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational structures differ by region.  We utilize a global approach to sales force training, marketing and medical education to provide consistent, high quality service.  Additionally, we keep current with key surgical developments and other issues related to orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, other specialists, dentists and oral surgeons and the medical and dental procedures they perform.

We allocate resources to achieve our operating profit goals through three operating segments.  Our operating segments are comprised of Americas and Global Businesses, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia Pacific.  The following is a summary of our operating segments.  See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our segments.

Americas and Global Businesses.  The Americas and Global Businesses operating segment is our largest operating segment.  This segment is comprised principally of the U.S. and includes other North, Central and South American markets for all of our product categories as well as the global results for our Dental products division.  This segment also includes our global manufacturing operations for all product categories and research, development engineering, medical education, and brand management for our global product category headquarter locations.  The U.S. accounts for 95 percent of net sales in this region.  The U.S. sales force consists of a combination of employees and independent sales agents, most of whom sell products exclusively for Zimmer Biomet.  The sales force in the U.S. receives a commission on product sales and is responsible for many operating decisions and costs.  

In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions within a specified group.  Generally, we are designated as one of several preferred purchasing sources for specified products, although members are not obligated to purchase our products.  Contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a term of three years, with extensions as warranted.  

In our Dental products division, our sales force is primarily composed of employees who market our products to customers.  We sell directly to dental practices or dental laboratories, or to independent stocking distributors depending on the market.

EMEA.  The EMEA operating segment is our second largest operating segment.  France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom collectively account for 57 percent of net sales in the region.  This segment also includes other key markets, including Switzerland, Benelux, Nordic, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  This operating segment includes all product categories in these markets, except for Dental.  Our sales force in this segment is comprised of direct sales associates, commissioned agents, independent distributors and sales support personnel.  We emphasize the advantages of our clinically proven, established designs and innovative solutions and new and enhanced materials and surfaces.  In most European countries, healthcare is sponsored by the government and therefore government budgets impact healthcare spending, which can affect our sales in this segment.  

Asia Pacific.  The Asia Pacific operating segment includes key markets such as Japan, China, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia.  Japan is the largest market within this segment, accounting for 50 percent of the region’s sales.  This operating segment includes all product categories in these markets, except for Dental.  In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales associates, who build and maintain relationships with orthopedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in their markets.  The knowledge and skills of these sales associates play a critical role in providing service, product information and support to surgeons.  

Seasonality

Our business is seasonal in nature to some extent, as many of our products are used in elective procedures, which typically decline during the summer months and can increase at the end of the year once annual deductibles have been met on health insurance plans.  Additionally, with sales to customers where title to product passes upon shipment, these customers may purchase items in large quantities if incentives are offered or if there are new product offerings in a market, which could cause period-to-period differences in sales.  Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, the typical seasonal patterns did not occur in 2020.

Distribution

We distribute our products both through large, centralized warehouses and through smaller, market specific facilities, depending on the needs of the market.  We maintain large, centralized warehouses in the U.S. and Europe to be able to efficiently distribute our products to customers in those regions.  In addition to these centralized warehouses, we maintain smaller distribution facilities in the U.S. and in each of the countries where we have a direct sales presence.  In many locations, our inventory is consigned to the healthcare institution.

We generally ship our orders via expedited courier.  Since most of our sales occur at the time of an elective procedure, we generally do not have firm orders.

Products

Our products include orthopedic reconstructive products; sports medicine, biologics, extremities and trauma products; office based technologies; spine and CMFT products; dental implants; and related surgical products.

KNEES

Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular surface (placed on the tibial tray).  Knee replacement surgeries include first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and revision procedures for the replacement, repair or enhancement of an implant or component from a previous procedure.  There are also procedures for partial reconstruction of the knee, which treat limited knee degeneration and involve the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis.  A developing trend in knee replacement surgeries is the use of robotic technologies to assist a surgeon with implant positioning.  In 2019, we entered the robotic assistance market with our ROSA® Knee System.  In the future, we plan to expand the use of our ROSA® Robot to other product categories.

Vanguard® Knee

 

•

Oxford® Partial Knee

HIPS

Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the natural hip.  Hip procedures include first-time, or primary, joint replacement as well as revision procedures.  Hip implant procedures involve the use of bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the surrounding bone, or are press-fit into bone, which means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies.

Our significant hip brands include the following:

S.E.T.

Our S.E.T. product category includes sports medicine, biologics, foot and ankle, extremities and trauma products.  Our sports medicine products are primarily for the repair of soft tissue injuries, most commonly used in the knee and shoulder.  Our biologics products are used as early intervention for joint preservation or to support surgical procedures.  Our foot and ankle and extremities products are designed to treat arthritic conditions and fractures in the foot, ankle, shoulder, elbow and wrist.  Our trauma products are used to stabilize damaged or broken bones and their surrounding tissues to support the body’s natural healing process.

DENTAL, SPINE and CMFT

Our Dental products division manufactures and/or distributes: 1) dental reconstructive implants – for individuals who are totally without teeth or are missing one or more teeth; 2) dental prosthetic products – aimed at providing a more natural restoration to resemble the original teeth; and 3) dental regenerative products – for soft tissue and bone rehabilitation.  Our spine products division designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices and surgical instruments to deliver comprehensive solutions for individuals with back or neck pain caused by degenerative conditions, deformities or traumatic injury of the spine.  A developing trend in spine surgeries is the use of robotic technologies to assist a surgeon in performing minimally invasive procedures.  We have entered the robotic market with our ROSA ONE® Spine.  Our CMFT division includes face and skull reconstruction products as well as products that fixate and stabilize the bones of the chest in order to facilitate healing or reconstruction after open heart surgery, trauma or for deformities of the chest.

OTHER

Our other product category primarily includes our surgical, bone cement and office based technology products.  

Research and Development

We have extensive research and development activities to develop new surgical techniques, including robotic techniques, materials, biologics and product designs.  The research and development teams work closely with our strategic brand marketing function.  The rapid commercialization of innovative new materials, biologics products, implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an important driver of sales growth.

We are broadening our offerings in certain of our product categories and exploring new technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, with possible applications in multiple areas.  Our primary research and development facility is located in Warsaw, Indiana.  We have other research and development personnel based in, among other places, Canada, China, France, Switzerland and other U.S. locations.  As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,000 research and development employees worldwide.

We expect to continue to identify innovative technologies, which may include acquiring complementary products or businesses, establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic alliances.  

Government Regulation and Compliance

Our operations, products and customers are subject to extensive government regulation by numerous government agencies, both within and outside the U.S.  Our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent, unpredictable and complex. There is a global trend toward increased regulatory activity related to medical products.

In the U.S., numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which our products are brought to market.  These include, among others, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and regulations issued or promulgated thereunder.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has enacted regulations that control all

7

 

aspects of the development, manufacture, advertising, promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including medical devices.  In addition, the FDA controls the access of products to market through processes designed to ensure that only products that are safe and effective are made available to the public.

Most of our new products fall into an FDA medical device classification that requires the submission of a Premarket Notification (510(k)) to the FDA.  This process requires us to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective as, that is, substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device.  We must submit information that supports our substantial equivalency claims.  Before we can market the new device, we must receive an order from the FDA finding substantial equivalence and clearing the new device for commercial distribution in the U.S.  

Other devices we develop and market are in a category (class) for which the FDA has implemented stringent clinical investigation and Premarket Approval (“PMA”) requirements.  The PMA process requires us to provide clinical and laboratory data that establishes that the new medical device is safe and effective.  The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA application constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s).  

All of our devices marketed in the U.S. have been cleared or approved by the FDA, with the exception of some devices which are classified by FDA regulation as exempt from premarket clearance and approval or were in commercial distribution prior to May 28, 1976.

In January 2021, the FDA announced a new “Action Plan” to address software as a medical device (“SaMD”) and artificial intelligence and machine learning (“AI/ML”).  Certain of our new products will likely incorporate innovations related to AI/ML, and therefore we will monitor developments in this area closely to determine our compliance obligations and risks.

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations.  The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices.  We are also subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820) (“QSR”), among other FDA requirements, such as requirements for advertising and promotion of our devices.  Our manufacturing operations, and those of our third-party manufacturers, are required to comply with the QSR, which addresses a company’s responsibility for product design, testing and manufacturing quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation.  The QSR requires that each manufacturer establish a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures relating to the devices.  QSR compliance is necessary to receive and maintain FDA clearance or approval to market new and existing products and is also necessary for distributing in the U.S. certain devices exempt from FDA clearance and approval requirements.  The FDA conducts announced and unannounced periodic and on-going inspections of medical device manufacturers to determine compliance with the QSR.  If in connection with these inspections the FDA believes the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures, it may issue inspectional observations on Form FDA-483 (“Form 483”) that would necessitate prompt corrective action.  If FDA inspectional observations are not addressed and/or corrective action is not taken in a timely manner and to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA may issue a warning letter (which would similarly necessitate prompt corrective action) and/or proceed directly to other forms of enforcement action, including the imposition of operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations, on one or more facilities, enjoining and restraining certain violations of applicable law pertaining to products, seizure of products, and assessing civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us.  The FDA could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us.  The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”).  Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For information regarding certain warning letters and Form 483 inspectional observations that we are addressing, see Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.

The FDA, in cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), administers controls over the import of medical devices into the U.S. and can prevent the importation of products the FDA deems to violate the FDCA or its implementing regulations.  The CBP imposes its own regulatory requirements on the import of our products, including inspection and possible sanctions for noncompliance.  We are also subject to foreign trade controls administered by certain U.S. government agencies, including the Bureau of Industry and Security within the Commerce Department and the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Treasury Department (“OFAC”).  In

8

 

addition, exported medical products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the medical product is exported.

There are also requirements of state and local governments that we must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.

In many of the countries in which our products are sold, we are subject to supranational, national, regional and local regulations affecting, among other things, the development, design, manufacturing, product standards, packaging, advertising, promotion, labeling, marketing and postmarket surveillance of medical products, including medical devices.  The member countries of the European Union (the “EU”) have adopted the European Medical Device Directive (the “MDD”), which creates a single set of medical device regulations for products marketed in all member countries.  Compliance with the MDD and certification to a quality system (e.g., ISO 13485 certification) enable the manufacturer to place a CE mark on its products.  To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to a product, a recognized European Notified Body must assess a manufacturer’s quality system and the product’s conformity to the requirements of the MDD.  We are subject to inspection by the Notified Bodies for compliance with these requirements.  In May 2017, a new EU Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) was published that will replace the MDD and will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements.  The effective date for the MDR has been extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with it currently scheduled to become effective in May 2021.  Under a corrigendum to the MDR finalized in December 2019, some low-risk medical devices being up-classified as a result of the MDR, including low-risk instruments, may now receive a transitional period to comply by May 2024.

Our quality management system is based upon the requirements of ISO 13485, the QSR, the MDD and other applicable regulations for the markets in which we sell.  Our principal manufacturing sites are certified to ISO 13485 and audited at regular intervals.  Additionally, our principal sites are certified under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”), which is a voluntary audit program developed by regulatory authorities in five countries (i.e., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the United States) to assess compliance with the quality management system regulatory requirements of those countries.  MDSAP audits are conducted by an MDSAP-recognized auditing organization and can fulfill the needs of the participating regulatory jurisdictions, replacing standard surveillance audits by the regulatory authorities in those countries.

Further, we are subject to other supranational, national, regional, federal, state and local laws concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims and anti-kickback laws, as well as the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state and foreign healthcare professional payment transparency laws.  These laws are administered by, among others, the DOJ, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG-HHS”), state attorneys general and various foreign government agencies.  Many of these agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical products manufacturers in recent years.  Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.  

Our operations in foreign countries are subject to the extraterritorial application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”).  Our global operations are also subject to foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the United Kingdom (“UK”) Bribery Act, among others.  As part of our global compliance program, we seek to address anti-corruption risks proactively.  On January 12, 2017, we resolved previously-disclosed FCPA matters involving Biomet and certain of its subsidiaries.  As part of that settlement, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ, which concluded on February 9, 2021, six months following certification to the DOJ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) by an independent compliance monitor that our compliance program, including its policies and procedures, is reasonably designed and implemented to prevent and detect violations of the FCPA and is functioning effectively.

Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the handling, storage and disposal of wastes and the clean-up of properties contaminated by pollutants.  We do not expect that the ongoing costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital expenditures or competitive position.

In addition, we are subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal and protection of health-related and other personal information.  The FDA has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical

9

 

devices.  The FDA and the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) have issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices.  

In addition, certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy, security and breach notification regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, “HIPAA”).  HIPAA governs the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by HIPAA “covered entities” and their “business associates.”  Covered entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions.  A business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity’s workforce) that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) (through the Office for Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with HIPAA regulations.  On December 10, 2020, HHS issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPR”) to modify the HIPAA privacy rule. The proposed modifications would remove communication barriers between providers and health plans, allow individuals more access to their health information and impose new requirements on entities that receive patient data requests. Separately, HHS (through the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology) issued a new rule, to be effective April 5, 2021, that seeks to limit “blocking” of electronic health information by imposing data access, software licensing and inter-operability requirements on healthcare providers and information technology vendors.  We intend to monitor both the NPR and the “information blocking” rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business.

In addition to the FDA guidance and HIPAA regulations described above, a number of U.S. states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, medical and financial information and other information.  These laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by U.S. federal laws.   For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals, and at times regulators, the media or credit reporting agencies, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information. Other state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which was signed into law on June 28, 2018 and took effect on January 1, 2020.  The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners. A second law called the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed via a ballot referendum in November 2020.  The CPRA expands the scope of the CCPA, imposes new restrictions on behavioral advertising and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency which will enforce the law and issue regulations.  Other states have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws.  We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigation and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.

Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and member state implementing legislation, and the Brazil Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (the “LGPD”), also apply to some of our operations in the countries in which we provide services to our customers.  Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve.  The GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year).

Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.

Competition

The orthopedics and broader musculoskeletal care industry is highly competitive.  In the global markets for our knees, hips, and S.E.T. products, our major competitors include the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Stryker Corporation and Smith & Nephew plc.  There are smaller competitors in these product categories as well who have success by focusing on smaller subsegments of the industry.  

10

 

In the spine and CMFT categories, we compete globally primarily with the spinal and biologic business of Medtronic plc, the DePuy Synthes Companies, Stryker Corporation, NuVasive, Inc. and Globus Medical, Inc.

In the dental implant category, we compete primarily with The Straumann Group, Dentsply Sirona Inc. and Nobel Biocare Services AG (part of Envista Holdings Corporation).

Competition within the industry is primarily based on technology, innovation, quality, reputation, customer service and pricing.  A key factor in our continuing success in the future will be our ability to develop new products and technologies and improve existing products and technologies.  

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

We manufacture our products at various sites.  We also strategically outsource some manufacturing to qualified suppliers who are highly capable of producing components.  

The manufacturing operations at our facilities are designed to incorporate the cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous improvement efforts in product quality, lead time reduction and capacity optimization.  Our continuous improvement efforts are driven by Lean and Six Sigma methodologies.  In addition, at certain of our manufacturing facilities, many of the employees are cross-trained to perform a broad array of operations.

We generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at optimal levels of total capacity.  We continually evaluate the potential to in‑source and outsource production as part of our manufacturing strategy to provide value to our stakeholders.

In most of our manufacturing network, we have improved our manufacturing processes to harmonize and optimize our quality systems and to protect our profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs.  We have, for example, employed computer-assisted robots and multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical devices; automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes, including on-machine inspection and process controls; purchased state-of-the-art equipment; in-sourced core products and processes; and negotiated cost reductions from third-party suppliers.  

We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the manufacturing of our products.  We purchase all of our raw materials and select components used in manufacturing our products from external suppliers.  In addition, we purchase some supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.  We work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability.  To date, we have not experienced any significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials necessary to fulfill our production schedules.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the continued success of our business.  We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position.  We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information.  We own or control through licensing arrangements over 9,000 issued patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our products.

Human Capital

As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 20,000 employees worldwide, including approximately 2,000 employees dedicated to research and development.  Approximately 10,000 employees are located within the U.S. and approximately 10,000 employees are located outside of the U.S., primarily throughout Europe and in Japan and China.  We have approximately 8,500 employees dedicated to manufacturing our products worldwide.  

Our mission is to alleviate pain and improve the quality of life for people around the world.  Our commitment to patients shapes all day-to-day decisions at Zimmer Biomet.  To be able to accomplish our mission we have established guiding principles.  These guiding principles are central to our human capital management policies and practices.  The guiding principles are:

11

 

 

•

Respect the contributions and perspectives of all employees

 

•

Commit to the highest standards of patient safety, quality and integrity

 

•

Focus our resources in areas where we will make a difference

 

•

Ensure the company’s return is equivalent to the value we provide our customers and patients

 

•

Give back to our communities and people in need.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We believe that each of us as individuals can drive change every day.  We remain wholly committed to creating, supporting and celebrating diverse and equal workplaces and communities.  Together, we will continue to foster and embrace diversity and inclusion within our team and our communities, and commit our voices and our resources to community groups, business platforms and other organizations united to driving meaningful change and sustained improvement.

We believe that representation matters.  As of December 31, 2020, women made up approximately 36 percent of our total employee population, and approximately 23 percent of positions at Director level and above.  People of Color (“POC”) made up approximately 24 percent of our total employee population in the U.S., and comprise approximately 14 percent of positions at Director level and above.  We recently made a statement about standing together united against hatred, discrimination and injustice.  However, we understand that words are not enough; we must act and be held accountable.  With this in mind, we are committing to the following initiatives to drive and accelerate change both within our own organization and around the globe.  We have shared these commitments publicly and are tracking our progress against them:  

 

•

Engage our 20,000 global employees in cultural awareness and inclusion programming.

 

•

Invest $1 million and provide executive sponsorship to support ongoing programs and elevate the impact of our employee resource groups.

 

•

Commit at least $5 million over five years through the Zimmer Biomet Foundation to non-profit organizations dedicated to combating racism and supporting diversity, equality and justice.  The Zimmer Biomet Foundation is an independent, non-profit organization established in 2018 to address the needs of our global community.

 

•

Match, through the Zimmer Biomet Foundation, employee financial contributions to non-profit organizations, including those dedicated to combating racism and supporting diversity, equality and justice.

 

•

Expand our student and early career internship programs to attract and develop more Black leaders.

 

•

Continue our financial support of Movement is Life, a multidisciplinary coalition seeking to eliminate racial, ethnic and gender disparities in muscle and joint health.

Employee Engagement

We value our employees’ input and to that end, from time-to-time, we conduct comprehensive employee engagement surveys that ultimately inform our actions towards improving employee engagement.  Surveys attempt to assess five drivers of engagement including purpose, culture, leadership, personal growth and belonging.  The key results of surveys, and commensurate action plans, are shared with our Board of Directors and with our employee base.  Employee engagement is the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes.  While we strive for engagement scores to sequentially improve, the outcomes of the surveys can be influenced by many factors that are internal and external to the company.  

We believe it is critical to keep our employees engaged through frequent and transparent communication.  This is accomplished through town halls, video and written messages, news and recognition on our intranet site, and various other methods.  To stay connected through the COVID-19 pandemic, our Chief Executive Officer has kept employees informed of our priorities, financial results, management response and employee health and safety through frequent video messages and written communications.

Health, Safety and Wellness

The physical and mental health, financial wellbeing, and work/life balance of our employees is vital to accomplishing our mission.  We sponsor wellness programs designed to enhance physical, financial and mental wellbeing for our employees.  We encourage participation in these programs through regular communications, educational sessions and other incentives.  

12

 

We are also acutely focused on the health and safety of our employees in the workplace.  Our environmental, health and safety team monitors various metrics to ensure we are providing a safe environment to work.  These results are shared with relevant regulatory agencies as required and presented to our Board of Directors.

Risk Factors  

We operate in a rapidly changing economic and technological environment that presents numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors.  In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations, including causing our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.  The following list of significant risk factors is not all-inclusive or necessarily in order of importance.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect us in future periods.  You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our securities.

Risks Related to our Business, Operations and Strategy

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.

Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19.  The global spread of COVID‑19 has had, and we expect it to continue to have, an adverse impact on demand for our products, our sales, our operations, our supply chains and distribution systems, and our expenses, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, and governments have taken and may continue to take.  Due to these impacts and measures, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions in the demand for our products as healthcare customers divert medical resources and priorities towards the treatment of COVID-19.  During 2020, we experienced a significant decline in procedure volumes globally as healthcare systems diverted resources to meet the increasing demands of managing COVID-19, and that decline has continued.  Additionally, public health bodies around the globe have at times recommended delaying elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic, and patients, surgeons and medical societies are evaluating the risks of elective surgeries in the presence of infectious diseases, which we expect will continue to negatively impact demand for our products and the number of procedures performed.

As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have experienced significant business disruptions, including restrictions on our ability to travel and to distribute our products, temporary closures of, or limited operations at, certain of our facilities and the facilities of our suppliers and contract manufacturers, as well as reduction in access to our customers due to diverted resources and priorities and the business hours of hospitals as governments institute prolonged shelter-in-place and/or self-quarantine mandates.  The unprecedented measures to slow the spread of the virus taken by local governments and healthcare authorities globally, including the deferral of elective surgical procedures and social distancing measures, have had, and we expect them to continue to have, a significant adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  These disruptions have resulted in the following among other unfavorable outcomes:

 

•

lower revenues, profits and cash flows compared to historic trends, including a net loss recognized in 2020 and negative operating cash flows in the second quarter of 2020;

 

•

bad debt charges as a result of being unable to collect on our accounts receivable;

 

•

additional charges from operating our manufacturing facilities at less than normal capacity;

 

•

goodwill impairment charges; and

15

 

 

 

•

delays in certain strategic projects and investments, including our restructuring plans, which will delay or may eliminate the effectiveness of these strategic initiatives.

If preventative and precautionary measures and/or the distribution of vaccines do not curb the spread of COVID-19, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may continue to be adversely affected.  Prolonged disruptions that cause deferral of elective surgical procedures may result in the following among other potential negative outcomes:

 

•

net losses and negative operating cash flows;

 

•

excess inventory we cannot sell, which would result in increased inventory charges;

 

•

our customers returning inventory to us, which would result in a reduction to our net sales;

 

•

additional charges from operating our manufacturing facilities at less than normal capacity;

 

•

additional goodwill impairment charges;

 

•

failing to satisfy the covenants in our credit facilities, which may cause any outstanding amounts to be payable immediately and could affect our access to capital to fund our business; and

 

•

downgrades to our credit ratings, which could result in increased interest expense.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and we expect it to continue to adversely affect, the economies and financial markets of many countries, which may result in a period of regional, national, and global economic slowdown or regional, national, or global recessions that could further negatively affect demand for our products as hospitals curtail or delay spending and individuals experiencing unemployment and/or a loss of healthcare benefits cancel or delay elective procedures, and could also increase the risk of customer defaults or delays in payments.  Our customers may terminate or amend their agreements for the purchase of our products due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, lack of funding, operational failures or other reasons.  COVID-19 and the current financial, economic and capital markets environment, and future developments in these and other areas, present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, volume of business, results of operations and cash flows.  Due to the uncertain scope and duration of the pandemic and uncertain timing of global recovery and economic normalization, we are unable to estimate the impacts on our operations and financial results.

Our restructuring program may not be successful or we may not fully realize the expected cost savings and/or operating efficiencies from our restructuring initiatives.

In December 2019, our Board of Directors approved, and we initiated, a global restructuring program (the “2019 Restructuring Plan”) with an objective of reducing costs to allow us to further invest in higher priority growth opportunities, which program is ongoing.  Restructuring initiatives involve complex plans and actions that may include, or result in, workforce reductions, global plant closures and/or consolidations, product portfolio rationalizations and asset impairments.  Additionally, as a result of restructuring initiatives, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiencies during transitional periods.  Restructuring initiatives present significant risks that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated operating enhancements and/or cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, including higher than anticipated costs in implementing our restructuring program, as well as management distraction. For more information on our restructuring program, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.  If we fail to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our success largely depends on key personnel, including our senior management, and having adequate succession plans in place. We may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business, which could harm our business.

Our future performance depends, in large part, on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel, in particular senior management, will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. There is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business. In particular, we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave, and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner.

16

 

Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations or achieve expected cost savings or profitability from our acquisitions.

Our acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:

 

•

unforeseen difficulties in integrating personnel and sales forces, operations, manufacturing, logistics, research and development, information technology, compliance, vendor management, communications, purchasing, accounting, marketing, administration and other systems and processes;

 

•

difficulties harmonizing and optimizing quality systems and operations;

 

•

diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;

 

•

unforeseen difficulties related to entering geographic regions where we do not have prior experience;

 

•

potential loss of key employees;

 

•

unforeseen risks and liabilities associated with businesses acquired, including any unknown vulnerabilities in acquired technology or compromises of acquired data; and

 

•

inability to generate sufficient revenue or realize sufficient cost savings to offset acquisition or investment costs.

As a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions properly, we might not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate.  These risks would likely be greater in the case of larger acquisitions.

The proposed spin-off of our Spine and Dental businesses may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the intended results.

On February 5, 2021, we announced our intention to pursue a plan to spin off our Spine and Dental businesses to form a new and independent, publicly traded company (“NewCo”) through a tax-free distribution to our stockholders of publicly traded stock in NewCo.  We are targeting completion of the spin-off in mid-2022.  Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect this proposed spin-off, including but not limited to disruptions in general market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory, tax and works council approvals or clearances.  In addition, consummation of the proposed spin-off is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, final approval of our Board of Directors, the receipt of a favorable opinion and Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the effectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement with the SEC.  Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete the spin-off on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, or at all.

We will incur significant expenses in connection with the spin-off.  In addition, completion of the proposed spin-off will require significant amounts of management’s time and effort which may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations.  The spin-off will also require modifications to our systems and processes used to operate our business.  We may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties related to these modifications which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Following the spin-off, we will be a smaller, less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could adversely affect our operating results.  We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the spin-off and following its completion, which could harm our business.

Further, if the spin-off is completed, the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction, strategic and competitive advantages of each company, and future growth and other opportunities for each company may not be realized within the expected time periods or at all.  Failure to implement the spin-off effectively could also result in a lower value to our company and our stockholders.

The proposed spin-off  may result in disruptions to, and negatively impact our relationships with, our customers and other business partners.

Parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the spin-off, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. Our business relationships may be subject to disruption as

17

 

customers, vendors and others may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions could adversely affect our business, including adversely affecting our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the spin-off.

The spin-off could result in substantial tax liability.

We intend to obtain an opinion and an IRS ruling as to the tax-free nature of the spin-off under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion and ruling will be based, among other things, on various factual assumptions and representations we will make. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinion and ruling may be jeopardized. If the spin-off does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to us and to NewCo stockholders could be substantial.

Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We have manufacturing sites all over the world.  In some instances, however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants.  Damage to one or more of our facilities from weather or natural disaster-related events, vulnerabilities in our technology, cyber-attacks against our information systems or the information systems of our business partners (such as ransomware attacks), or issues in our manufacturing arising from failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the QSR and Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, equipment breakdown or malfunction, reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics, or other factors could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.  In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand.  In the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to the need for regulatory approvals.  As a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party suppliers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party suppliers and we outsource some key manufacturing activities.  Certain of these materials and components and outsourced activities can only be obtained from a single source or a limited number of sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements.  In certain cases, we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or components or outsourced activities in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our suppliers' manufacturing processes.  A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials or components used in manufacturing our products, such as due to one or more suppliers experiencing reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service.  To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, including federal and state regulations on the use of ethylene oxide, or reductions in operations and/or worker absences due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

Moreover, we are subject to the SEC’s rule regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as “conflict minerals” (tantalum, tin and tungsten (or their ores) and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.  This rule could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of materials used in the manufacture of our products, which could adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.  In addition, we are incurring additional costs to comply with this rule, including costs related to determining the source of any relevant minerals and metals used in our products.  We have a complex supply chain and we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals and metals used in our products through our

18

 

due diligence procedures.  As a result, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders.

We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and if we fail to effectively maintain or protect our information systems or data, including from data breaches, our business could be adversely affected.

We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our products and infrastructure.  As a result of technology initiatives, expanding privacy and cybersecurity laws, changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions, we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities.  In addition, some of our products and services incorporate software or information technology that collects data regarding patients and patient therapy, and some products or software we provide to customers connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes.  We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and, as a result, we manage a number of third-party suppliers who may or could have access to our confidential information, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information of patients, employees and customers (collectively “Confidential Information”).  

Our information systems, and those of third-party suppliers with whom we contract, require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, changing threats and vulnerabilities,  and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information.  In addition, given their size and complexity, these systems could be vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties attempting to gain unauthorized access to our products, systems or Confidential Information.  

Like other large multi-national corporations, we have experienced instances of successful phishing attacks on our email systems and expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. We also are subject to other cyber-attacks, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks, industrial espionage, insider threats, computer denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, ransomware and other malware, payment fraud or other cyber incidents.  In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant number of our employees who are able to work remotely are doing so, and malicious cyber actors may increase malware campaigns and phishing emails targeting teleworkers, preying on the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, which exposes us to additional cybersecurity risks.  Our incident response efforts, business continuity procedures and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities.  If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could:

 

•

lose existing customers, vendors and business partners;

 

•

have difficulty attracting new customers;

 

•

have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing;

 

•

suffer outages or disruptions in our operations or supply chain;

 

•

have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud;

 

•

have disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals;  

 

•

have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed;

 

•

incur increased operating expenses;

 

•

be subject to issues with product functionality that may result in a loss of data, risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls;

 

•

incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach; or

 

•

suffer other adverse consequences.

While we have invested heavily in the protection of our data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our activities related to consolidating the number of systems we operate, upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems and implementing new systems will be successful.  We will continue to dedicate significant resources to protect against unauthorized access to our systems and work with government authorities to detect and reduce the risk of future cyber incidents; however, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated, frequent and adaptive. Therefore, despite our efforts, we cannot assure that cyber-attacks or data breaches will not occur or that systems issues will not arise in the future.  Any significant breakdown, intrusion, breach, interruption, corruption or destruction of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.

19

 

Our success depends on our ability to effectively develop and market our products against those of our competitors.

We operate in a highly competitive environment.  Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by one or more of our present or future competitors or by other therapies, including biological therapies.  To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and acquire new products and technologies and improve existing products and technologies.  Competition is primarily on the basis of:

 

•

technology;

 

•

innovation;

 

•

quality;

 

•

reputation;

 

•

customer service; and

 

•

pricing.

In markets outside of the U.S., other factors influence competition as well, including:

 

•

local distribution systems;

 

•

complex regulatory environments; and

 

•

differing medical philosophies and product preferences.

Our competitors may:

 

•

have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us;

 

•

respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies;

 

•

undertake more extensive marketing campaigns;

 

•

adopt more aggressive pricing policies; or

 

•

be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.

Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could cause us to have difficulty maintaining or increasing sales of our products.

If we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely heavily to market our products, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Our marketing success in the U.S. and abroad depends significantly upon our agents’ and distributors’ sales and service expertise in the marketplace.  Many of these agents have developed professional relationships with existing and potential customers because of the agents’ detailed knowledge of products and instruments.  A loss of a significant number of our agents could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.

Demand for our products may change, in certain cases, in ways we may not anticipate because of:

 

•

evolving customer needs;

 

•

changing demographics;

 

•

slowing industry growth rates;

 

•

declines in the musculoskeletal implant market;

 

•

the introduction of new products and technologies;

 

•

evolving surgical philosophies; and

 

•

evolving industry standards.

Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time.  If that happens, our revenue and operating results would suffer.  The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:

 

•

properly identify and anticipate customer needs;

 

•

commercialize new products in a timely manner;

 

•

manufacture and deliver instruments and products in sufficient volumes on time;

20

 

 

 

•

differentiate our offerings from competitors’ offerings; 

 

•

achieve positive clinical outcomes for new products; 

 

•

satisfy the increased demands by healthcare payors, providers and patients for shorter hospital stays, faster post-operative recovery and lower-cost procedures;

 

•

innovate and develop new materials, product designs and surgical techniques; and

 

•

provide adequate medical education relating to new products.

In addition, new materials, product designs and surgical techniques that we develop may not be accepted quickly, in some or all markets, because of, among other factors:

 

•

entrenched patterns of clinical practice;

 

•

the need for regulatory clearance; and

 

•

uncertainty with respect to third-party reimbursement.

Moreover, innovations generally require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine their commercial viability and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund the production.  In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.

If third-party payors decline to reimburse our customers for our products or reduce reimbursement levels, the demand for our products may decline and our ability to sell our products profitably may be harmed.

We sell our products and services to hospitals, doctors, dentists and other healthcare providers, which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payors, such as domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs.  These third-party payors may deny reimbursement if they determine that a product or service used in a procedure was not in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication.  Third-party payors may also decline to reimburse for experimental procedures and products.

In addition, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services.  If third-party payors reduce reimbursement levels or change reimbursement models for hospitals and other healthcare providers for our products, demand for our products may decline, or we may experience increased pressure to reduce the prices of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

We have also experienced downward pressure on product pricing and other effects of healthcare reform in our international markets.  If key participants in government healthcare systems reduce the reimbursement levels for our products, including through political changes or transitions, our sales and results of operations may be adversely affected.

The ongoing cost-containment efforts of healthcare purchasing organizations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Many customers for our products have formed group purchasing organizations in an effort to contain costs.  Group purchasing organizations negotiate pricing arrangements with medical supply manufacturers and distributors, and these negotiated prices are made available to a group purchasing organization’s affiliated hospitals and other members.  If we are not one of the providers selected by a group purchasing organization, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and, if the group purchasing organization has negotiated a strict compliance contract for another manufacturer’s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the group purchasing organization for the duration of the contractual arrangement.  Our failure to respond to the cost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations may cause us to lose market share to our competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

Financial, Credit and Liquidity Risks

We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions and may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations, and the phase-out, replacement or unavailability of LIBOR and/or other interest rate benchmarks could adversely affect our indebtedness.

We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with previous mergers and acquisitions.  At December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was $8.1 billion, as compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014.  As of December 31, 2020, our debt service obligations, comprised of principal and interest (excluding leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months are expected to be $0.7 billion.  As a result of the increase in our debt, demands on our cash resources have increased.  The increased level of debt could, among other things:

 

•

require us to dedicate a large portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

 

•

limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, research and development expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

 

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

 

•

restrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;

 

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

 

•

adversely affect our credit rating, with the result that the cost of servicing our indebtedness might increase and our ability to obtain surety bonds could be impaired;

 

•

adversely affect the market price of our common stock; and

 

•

limit our ability to apply proceeds from a future offering or asset sale to purposes other than the servicing and repayment of debt.

In addition, the interest rates applicable to certain of our debt obligations are based on a fluctuating rate of interest determined by reference to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) and/or Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”).  Any increase in interest rates applicable to our debt obligations would increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Further, in July 2017, the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates to the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (together with any successor, “IBA”).  In response to concerns regarding the future of LIBOR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) to identify alternatives to LIBOR.  The ARRC has recommended a benchmark replacement waterfall to assist issuers in continued capital market entry while safeguarding against LIBOR’s discontinuation.  The initial steps in the ARRC’s recommended provision reference variations of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”).  In November 2020, the IBA announced a proposal that the cessation date for the submission and publication of certain tenors of U.S. dollar denominated LIBOR (including one-, three-, six- and twelve-month LIBOR) be extended to June 30, 2023.  At this time, it is not possible to predict whether SOFR will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement, and it remains uncertain if LIBOR in applicable tenors and applicable currencies will cease to exist after calendar year 2021, or whether additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted, or whether alternative reference rates will gain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR.  Further, other central banks have convened working groups to determine replacements or reforms of other interest rate benchmarks, such as EURIBOR, and it is expected, although not known, that a transition away from the use of certain of these other interest rate benchmarks will occur over the course of the next few years and alternative reference rates (such as the euro short-term rate (€STR)) will be established or gain market acceptance.

Certain of our debt obligations that are based on LIBOR will mature before the end of 2021.  However, the revolving credit agreement that we entered into on November 1, 2019 (the “2019 Credit Agreement”) has an initial maturity date of November 1, 2024.  In anticipation of LIBOR’s phase out, the 2019 Credit Agreement provides for alternative base rates as well as a transition mechanism for selecting a benchmark replacement rate for LIBOR, with such benchmark replacement rate to be mutually agreed with the general administrative agent and our lenders.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with our lenders on any such replacement benchmark before experiencing adverse effects due to changes in interest rates, if at all.  We will continue to monitor the situation and address the potential reference rate changes in future debt obligations that we may incur.  Accordingly, the potential effect of the phase-out, replacement or unavailability of LIBOR, or the unavailability of any other interest rate benchmark such as EURIBOR or TIBOR, on our cost of capital cannot yet

22

 

be determined.  Further, the use of an alternative base rate or a benchmark replacement rate as a basis for calculating interest with respect to any outstanding variable rate indebtedness could lead to an increase in the interest we pay and a corresponding increase in our costs of capital or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We may have additional tax liabilities.

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  We are regularly under audit by tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.

Changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense, could result in a material increase in our tax expense.  For example, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the “base erosion and profit shifting” project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”).  The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles.  These changes, as adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The results of the U.S. presidential election could lead to changes in tax laws that could negatively impact our effective tax rate.

Prior to the recent U.S. presidential election, President Biden proposed an increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%, increasing the rate of tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries, imposition of an offshoring tax penalty, and a 15% minimum tax on worldwide book income. If any or all of these (or similar) proposals are ultimately enacted into law, in whole or in part, they could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

If our independent agents and distributors are characterized as employees, we would be subject to additional tax and other liabilities.

We structure our relationships with independent agents and distributors in a manner that we believe results in an independent contractor relationship, not an employee relationship. Although we believe that our independent agents and distributors are properly characterized as independent contractors, tax or other regulatory authorities may in the future challenge our characterization of these relationships. Further, we have been subject to lawsuits challenging the characterization of these relationships in recent years. Changes in classification from independent contractor to employee can result in a change to various requirements associated with the payment of wages, tax withholding, and the provision of unemployment, health, and other traditional employer-employee related benefits. If regulatory authorities or state, federal or foreign courts were to determine that our independent agents or distributors are employees, and not independent contractors, we would be required to withhold income taxes, to withhold and pay social security, Medicare and similar taxes and to pay unemployment and other related payroll taxes. We would also be liable for unpaid past taxes and subject to penalties. As a result, any determination that our independent agents and distributors are our employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Future material impairments in the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results.

Goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets.  At December 31, 2020, we had $9.3 billion in goodwill and $7.1 billion of intangible assets.  The goodwill results from our acquisition activity and represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired.  We assess at least annually whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable.  As discussed further in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements, in the first quarter of 2020, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $612.0 million as a result of the adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and a change in our reportable segments, and in the second quarter of 2020, we recorded $33.0 million of in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) intangible asset impairments on certain IPR&D projects.  If the operating performance at one or more of our reporting units falls significantly below current levels, including if elective surgical procedures are deferred longer than our current expectations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, if

23

 

competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions or future cash flow estimates for one or more of our businesses decline, or as a result of restructuring initiatives pursuant to which we reorganize our reporting units, we could be required to record additional impairment charges.  Any write-off of a material portion of our goodwill or unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations.

Global Operational Risks

We conduct a significant amount of our sales activity outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks and may cause our profitability to decline due to increased costs.

We sell our products in more than 100 countries and derived approximately 40 percent of our net sales in 2020 from outside the U.S.  We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales internationally, including in emerging markets, which could expose us to additional risks associated with international sales and operations.  Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:

 

•

changes in foreign medical reimbursement policies and programs;

 

•

changes in foreign regulatory requirements, such as more stringent requirements for regulatory clearance of products;

 

•

differing local product preferences and product requirements;

 

•

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

 

•

diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries outside of the U.S.;

 

•

trade protection measures, import or export requirements, new or increased tariffs, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers, which may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and may increase our operating costs;

 

•

foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;

 

•

complex data privacy and cybersecurity requirements and labor relations laws;

 

•

extraterritorial effects of U.S. laws such as the FCPA;

 

•

effects of foreign anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act;

 

•

difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

 

•

labor force instability;

 

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws; and

 

•

political, social and economic instability and uncertainty, including sovereign debt issues.

Violations of foreign laws or regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation.

We are subject to risks arising from currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can increase our costs, cause our profitability to decline and expose us to counterparty risks.

A substantial portion of our foreign revenues is generated in Europe and Japan.  The U.S. Dollar value of our foreign-generated revenues varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Significant increases in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc or other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Although we address currency risk management through regular operating and financing activities, and, on a limited basis, through the use of derivative financial instruments, those actions may not prove to be fully effective or may create additional financial obligations for us.  Further, if the counterparties to the derivative financial instrument transactions fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from those transactions.

Developments relating to the UK’s exit from the EU could adversely affect us.

The UK ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” and entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020 (the “Transition Period”), during which terms for the future trading relationship between the EU and UK were negotiated.  On December 30, 2020, the UK and the EU signed the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which applies provisionally (pending ratification by the Council of the European Union) with effect from the end of the Transition Period.  As of the end of the Transition Period, the UK and the EU became separate and distinct legal and regulatory jurisdictions.

24

 

Brexit has resulted in certain new restrictions on the free movement of goods, services and people between the UK and the EU, through technical barriers to trade, rules of origin requirements, custom inspections, and/or migration restrictions.  In terms of medical products regulation and trade, the now separate UK and EU approval and regulatory regimes may, in the near term or over time, require us to make adjustments to our business and operations that could result in significant expense and take significant time to complete.  Over time, Brexit could also result in increasing regulatory and/or standards divergence between the UK and the EU, which could affect the clearance and approval of medical products in each or either jurisdiction.

Despite the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, Brexit and the perceptions as to its potential impact have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, business activity and economic conditions in the UK, Europe and globally, and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets.  

Given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate, as well as the lack of comparable precedent, the full extent to which we will be affected by Brexit remains uncertain.  Any of the potential negative effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks

We are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations relating to the development, design, product standards, packaging, advertising, promotion, postmarket surveillance, manufacturing, labeling and marketing of our products, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent, unpredictable and complex. The products we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other supranational, national, federal, regional, state and local governmental authorities.  The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market these products can be costly and time consuming and approvals might not be granted for future products on a timely basis, if at all.  Delays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs.

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations and other supranational, national, federal, regional, state and local requirements globally.  Compliance with these requirements, including the QSR, recordkeeping regulations, labeling and promotional requirements and adverse event reporting regulations, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulators, which may result in observations (such as on Form 483), and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action, or other forms of enforcement.  If the FDA or another regulator were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, they could ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of payment of such products, refuse to grant pending premarket approval applications, refuse to provide certificates for exports, and/or require us to notify healthcare professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health.  The FDA or other regulators may also impose operating restrictions, including a ceasing of operations at one or more facilities, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to our products, seizure of products and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees or us.  The FDA or other regulators could also issue a corporate warning letter or a recidivist warning letter or negotiate the entry of a consent decree of permanent injunction with us, and/or recommend prosecution.  Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In August 2018, we received a warning letter from the FDA related to observed non-conformities with current good manufacturing practice requirements of the QSR at our Warsaw North Campus manufacturing facility.  As of February 14, 2021, this warning letter remained pending.  Until the violations are corrected, we may become subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA as described above, the FDA may refuse to grant premarket approval applications and/or the FDA may refuse to grant export certificates, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additional information regarding these and other FDA regulatory matters can be found in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.

Governmental regulations outside the U.S. continue to become increasingly stringent and complex.  In the EU, for example, the MDR is expected to become effective in May 2021 and will include significant additional premarket and post-market requirements.  Complying with the requirements of this regulation requires us to incur significant expense.  Additionally, the availability of EU notified body services certified to the new requirements is limited,

25

 

which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under the MDR.  Any such delays, or any failure to meet the requirements of the new regulation, could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.

Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, such as the International Standards Organization.  If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our business could be harmed.

If we fail to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse or data privacy and security laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical products companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny around the world.  Our industry is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including the False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark law, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and similar laws and regulations in the U.S. and around the world.  In addition, we are subject to various laws concerning anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters (including the FCPA), sales to countries or persons subject to economic sanctions and other matters affecting our international operations.  Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment and, within the U.S., exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.  These laws are administered by, among others, the DOJ, the OIG-HHS, the SEC, the OFAC, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce and state attorneys general.

We are also subject to federal, state and international data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal and protection of health-related and other personal information.  The FDA has issued guidance to which we may be subject concerning data security for medical devices.  The FDA and the DHS have also issued urgent safety communications regarding cybersecurity vulnerabilities of certain medical devices, which vulnerabilities may apply to some of our current or future devices.  

In addition, certain of our affiliates are subject to privacy, security and breach notification regulations promulgated under HIPAA.  HIPAA governs the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by HIPAA “covered entities” and their “business associates.”  Covered entities are health plans, health care clearinghouses and health care providers that engage in specific types of electronic transactions.  A business associate is any person or entity (other than members of a covered entity’s workforce) that performs a service on behalf of a covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information.  HHS (through the Office for Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority against covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with HIPAA regulations.  On December 10, 2020, HHS issued an NPR to modify the HIPAA privacy rule.  Separately, HHS (through the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology) issued a new rule, to be effective April 5, 2021, that will limit “blocking” of electronic health information.  We intend to monitor both the NPR and the “information blocking” rule and assess their impact on the use of data in our business.

In addition to the FDA guidance and HIPAA regulations described above, a number of U.S. states have also enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, medical and financial information and other personal information.  These laws and regulations may be more restrictive and not preempted by U.S. federal laws.  For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states now have data breach laws that require timely notification to individuals, and at times regulators, the media or credit reporting agencies, if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information.  Other state laws include the CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020.  The CCPA, among other things, contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals numerous rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information or share it with our business partners.  A second law in California, the CPRA, passed via a ballot referendum in November 2020.  The CPRA expands the scope of the CCPA and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency that will enforce the law and issue regulations.  The CPRA is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023, with a lookback to January 1, 2022.  Other states have considered and/or enacted similar privacy laws.  We will continue to monitor and assess the impact of these state laws, which may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business.  

Outside of the U.S., data protection laws, including the GDPR in Europe and the LGPD in Brazil, also apply to our operations in those countries in which we provide services to our customers.  Legal requirements in these countries relating to the collection, storage, processing and transfer of personal data continue to evolve.  The GDPR imposes, among other things, data protection requirements that include strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer EU personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and

supervisory authorities in certain circumstances, and possible substantial fines for any violations (including possible fines for certain violations of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year).  Governmental authorities around the world have enacted similar types of legislative and regulatory requirements concerning data protection, and additional governments are considering similar legal frameworks.

The interpretation and enforcement of the laws and regulations described above are uncertain and subject to change, and may require substantial costs to monitor and implement compliance with any additional requirements.  Failure to comply with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Pending and future product liability claims and litigation could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our reputation.

Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.  In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.  As discussed further in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, we are defending product liability lawsuits relating to the Durom® Acetabular Component (“Durom Cup”), certain products within the M/L Taper and M/L Taper with Kinectiv® Technology hip stems and Versys® Femoral Head implants, and the M2a-MagnumTM hip system.  We are also currently defending a number of other product liability lawsuits and claims related to various other products.  Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, can be costly to defend.  Product liability lawsuits and claims, safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers.

We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights, and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.

Claims of intellectual property infringement and litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights are commonplace in our industry and are frequently time consuming and costly.  At any given time, we may be involved as either plaintiff or defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.  While it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent and other intellectual property litigation, such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and proprietary rights against others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.  As previously disclosed, in March 2019 we paid approximately $168 million related to an award of treble damages and attorneys’ fees in a patent infringement lawsuit.

Our success depends in part on our proprietary technology, processes, methodologies and information.  We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and nondisclosure, license, assignment and confidentiality arrangements to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights, as well as the intellectual property rights of third parties whose assets we license.  However, the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property, may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation or theft of our intellectual property.  Further, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with any competitive advantage.  Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.  We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information.  

In addition, intellectual property laws differ in various jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change at any time, which could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.  In particular, a portion of our revenues is derived from jurisdictions where adequately protecting intellectual property rights may prove more challenging or impossible.  We may also not be able to detect unauthorized uses or take timely and effective steps to remedy unauthorized conduct.  To prevent or respond to unauthorized uses of our intellectual property, we might be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation or other proceedings

and we may not ultimately prevail.  Any failure to establish, maintain or protect our intellectual property or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

We are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.

In addition to intellectual property and product liability claims and lawsuits, we are involved in various commercial and securities litigation and claims and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.  For example, as discussed further in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, there have been four shareholder derivative actions filed purportedly on our behalf against certain of our current and former directors and officers and certain former stockholders of ours who sold shares of our common stock in secondary public offerings in 2016, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties and insider trading, based on allegations that we made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or omissions about our compliance with FDA regulations and our ability to continue to accelerate our organic revenue growth rate in the second half of 2016.  Although we believe there are substantial defenses in these matters, litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future.  Given the uncertain nature of legal proceedings generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome.  We could in the future incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period.

Risks Related to Our Organizational Documents and Jurisdiction of Incorporation

Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.

Certain provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Restated By-Laws and the Delaware General Corporation Law may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.

These provisions provide for, among other things:

 

•

the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock without further stockholder action;

 

•

advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;

 

•

certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; and

 

•

the prohibition on engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for three years after the time at which a person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met, as set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders.  As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.

Our Restated By-Laws designate certain Delaware courts as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.

Our Restated By-Laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder (including any beneficial owner) to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Restated By-Laws, as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine.  Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions.  This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.  Alternatively, if a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in

respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Properties

We own or lease approximately 350 different facilities around the world, of which approximately half are in the U.S.  Our corporate headquarters is in Warsaw, Indiana.  Warsaw, Indiana is also home to our most significant manufacturing, research and development (“R&D”), and other business activities for our Knees, Hips and S.E.T. product divisions.  Our Spine, CMFT, Office Based Technologies and Dental products divisions also have business unit headquarters located in the U.S. that are the primary facilities for these product divisions’ manufacturing, R&D and other business activities.  Internationally, our EMEA regional headquarters is in Switzerland and our Asia Pacific regional headquarters is in Singapore.

We have approximately 30 manufacturing locations in the U.S. and internationally.  Our most significant locations outside of the U.S. are in Switzerland, Ireland, the U.K., China, and Puerto Rico.  We primarily own our manufacturing facilities in the U.S.; internationally, we occupy both owned and leased manufacturing facilities.

We maintain sales and administrative offices and warehouse and distribution facilities in more than 40 countries around the world.  These local market facilities are primarily leased due to common businesses practices and to allow us to be more adaptable to changing needs in the market.

We distribute our products both through large, centralized warehouses and through smaller, market specific facilities, depending on the needs of the market.  We maintain large, centralized warehouses in the U.S. and the Netherlands to be able to efficiently distribute our products to customers in the U.S. and EMEA.

We believe that all of the facilities and equipment are in good condition, well maintained and able to operate at present levels.  We believe the current facilities, including manufacturing, warehousing, R&D and office space, provide sufficient capacity to meet ongoing demands.

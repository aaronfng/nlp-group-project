MGM Resorts International is referred to as the “Company,” “MGM Resorts,” or the “Registrant,” and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” Except where the context indicates otherwise, “MGP” refers to MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.

 

Overview

 

MGM Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau.

 

We believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests.

 

MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through its subsidiary MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). As of December 31, 2020, pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, we lease the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, and MGM Northfield Park. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements, and Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP. Pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a venture that is 5% owned by such subsidiary and 95% owned by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”, and such venture, the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”), we lease the real estate assets of Bellagio. Additionally, pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a venture that is 50.1% owned by a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership and 49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT (such venture, the “MGP BREIT Venture”), we lease the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the leases.

 

Business Developments

 

In August 2016, we acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of ours. Subsequently, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from us and Borgata was added to the master lease between us and MGP. In December 2016, we opened MGM National Harbor and, in October 2017, MGP also acquired the long-term leasehold interest and real property associated with MGM National Harbor from us and MGM National Harbor was added to the master lease between us and MGP.

 

In February 2018, we opened MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau, and in August 2018, we opened MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts.

 

In July 2018, MGP acquired the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio limited liability company that owned the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park (“Northfield Acquisition”). In April 2019, we acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. We then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park and added it to the master lease between us and MGP.

 

In July 2018, we and Entain plc (“Entain”) formed BetMGM LLC (“BetMGM”), a venture that is owned 50% by each party. In connection with its formation, we provided BetMGM with exclusive access to all of our domestic land-based and online sports betting, major tournament poker, and online gaming operations and Entain provided BetMGM with exclusive access to its technology in the United States.

 

In January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City Casino's racetrack and casino ("Empire City"). Subsequently, MGP acquired Empire City’s developed real property from us and Empire City was added to the master lease between us and MGP.

In March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the master lease between us and MGP with respect to improvements made by us related to the rebranding of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Transaction”).

 

Additionally, in November 2019, the Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from us and leased such assets back to us pursuant to a lease agreement. The lease provides for a term of thirty years with two ten year renewal options and has an initial annual base rent of $245 million, escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first ten years and thereafter equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of 3% during the 11th through 20th years and 4% thereafter. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the property on capital expenditures and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to rent for the succeeding two year period. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, we received total consideration of $4.25 billion, which consisted of a 5% equity interest in the venture and approximately $4.2 billion in cash. We also provide a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of the Bellagio BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon).

 

In December 2019, we completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million, which consisted of $662.5 million paid in cash and a secured note due 2024 with a face value of $162.5 million and fair value of $133.7 million.

 

On February 14, 2020, we completed a series of transactions (collectively the “MGP BREIT Venture Transaction”) pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to the newly formed MGP BREIT Venture. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, MGM and MGP received total consideration of $4.6 billion, which was comprised of $2.5 billion of cash, $1.3 billion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by the MGP BREIT Venture, and the Operating Partnership’s 50.1% equity interest in the MGP BREIT Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately 3 million Operating Partnership units to us representing 5% of the equity value of the MGP BREIT Venture. We also provide a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of the MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately 5 million MGP Class A shares for $150 million.

 

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. The lease provides for a term of thirty years with two ten-year renewal options and has an initial annual base rent of $292 million, escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first fifteen years and thereafter equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of 3%. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capital expenditures and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding one-year period. Additionally, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual cash rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million.

 

Also, on January 14, 2020, we, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right following the closing of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to us in connection with us exercising our right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem the Operating Partnership units that we hold, at a price per unit equal to a 3% discount to the ten day average closing price prior to the date of the notice of redemption. The waiver was effective upon closing of the transaction on February 14, 2020 and was scheduled to terminate on the earlier of February 14, 2022 or upon our receipt of cash proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption of our Operating Partnership units. On May 18, 2020 the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 30 million Operating Partnership units that we held for $700 million, or $23.10 per unit, and on December 2, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 24 million Operating Partnership units that we held for the remaining $700 million, or $29.78 per unit. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

Financial Impact of COVID-19. The spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2021. In March 2020, all of our domestic properties temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, all of our properties re-opened to the public but continue to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, with restrictions varying by jurisdiction and with further temporary re-closures and re-openings occurring for our properties or portions of our properties into the first quarter of 2021. In response to reduced demand, we temporarily closed the hotel tower operations at Mandalay Bay and Park MGM midweek and temporarily closed The Mirage midweek, which are expected to resume full week operations on March 3, 2021. Accordingly, our properties have continued to generate revenues that are significantly lower than historical results. In addition, as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of variant strains, our properties may be subject to temporary, complete, or partial shutdowns in the future. At this time, we cannot predict whether the jurisdictions in which our properties are located, states or the federal government will continue to impose operating restrictions on us or adopt similar or more restrictive measures in the future, including stay-at-home orders or ordering the temporary closures of all or a portion of our

2

 

properties. We have implemented certain measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including limitations on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and on the number of seats at each table game, as well as slot machine spacing, temperature checks, mask protection, limitations on restaurant capacity, entertainment events and conventions, as well as other measures to enforce social distancing. In addition, following a temporary closure of our properties in Macau on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain health safeguards, such as limiting the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars, temperature checks, mask protection and the need to present negative COVID-19 test results and health declarations submitted through the Macau Health Code system which remain in effect. Effective July 15, 2020, all guests entering our casinos were required to provide a negative nucleic acid test result with a valid ‘green’ Macau Health Code. Although the issuance of tourist visas (including the individual visa scheme (“IVS”)) for residents of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province and all other provinces in mainland China to travel to Macau resumed on August 12, 2020, August 26, 2020 and September 23, 2020, respectively, several travel and entry restrictions in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China remain in place (including the temporary suspension of ferry services from Hong Kong to Macau, the nucleic acid test result certificate and mandatory quarantine requirements for visitors from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and bans on entry or enhanced quarantine requirements on other visitors into Macau), which have significantly impacted visitation to our Macau properties.

 

While we have engaged in aggressive cost reduction efforts to minimize cash outflows while our properties were initially closed, and have continued to engage in such efforts as the properties have re-opened, we still have significant fixed and variable expenses, which have and will continue to adversely affect our profitability. In addition, we have seen, and expect to continue to see, weakened demand at our properties as a result of continued domestic and international travel restrictions or warnings, restrictions on amenity use, such as gaming, restaurant and pool capacity limitations, consumer fears and reduced consumer discretionary spending, general economic uncertainty, and increased rates of unemployment. In light of the foregoing, we are unable to determine when our properties will return to pre-pandemic demand and pricing, or if our properties will remain re-opened. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2020 and we expect that it will continue to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations during 2021 and potentially thereafter.

 

Resort Operations

 

General

 

Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments, and repay debt financings.

 

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts, except as otherwise described related to the impact of COVID-19, typically operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Empire City Casino which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. Our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We also lease space to third party retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.

 

As of December 31, 2020, we have three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China.

 

Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations

Las Vegas Strip Resorts. Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including The Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas (until the sale of such property in December 2019).

Regional Operations. Regional Operations consists of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York (upon its acquisition in January 2019); and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio (upon MGM’s acquisition of the operations from MGP in April 2019).

Over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is typically derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities. Although we have been operating without certain amenities and subject to certain limitations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our long-term strategy is to market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.

 

Our casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games, and, through BetMGM, we offer online sports betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictions in the United States. In addition, we provide our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.

 

MGM China

 

We own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Although visitation during 2020 was significantly reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.

 

Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A., which expires in 2022. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos or gaming areas require government approval prior to commencing operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — The Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”

 

Corporate and Other

 

We have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. Our unconsolidated affiliates include the ventures with BREIT discussed elsewhere, BetMGM, and CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”), which we also manage for a fee, among others.

 

See Note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed financial information about our segments.

Customers and Competition

 

Our properties operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, iGaming and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business — We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”

 

Our primary methods of successful competition include:

 
	

•
	

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;

 
	

•
	

Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;

 
	

•
	

Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;

 
	

•
	

Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and

 
	

•
	

Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.

 

Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations

 

Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a diverse portfolio of properties, which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our properties have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our properties during midweek and off-peak periods.

 

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings, or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.

 

Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.

 

MGM China

 

The three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who assist VIP players with their travel and entertainment arrangements. Gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover-based commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution from the main floor gaming operations exceeds the VIP gaming operations due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. We offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion to attract ultra-high end customers.

VIP gaming at MGM China is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customer-related expenses. Gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.

Our key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. If the Macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai Strip.

 

We encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Australia, and Las Vegas.

 

Marketing

 

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships. 

 

M life Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers, in addition to M life Rewards, at MGM China. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.

 

Strategy

 

We strive to be a leader in the global gaming, entertainment and hospitality industry that delivers extraordinary entertainment across a portfolio of properties in the United States and Macau. The quality of our properties and amenities is evidenced by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association, multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide and numerous certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.

 

Our strategic objectives include:

 
	

•
	

People. Implement programs to enhance recruitment, talent management and development, as well as diversity and inclusion, to support the achievement of key business drivers including guest experience, community engagement and financial goals.

 
	

•
	

Operational excellence. Exceed customer expectations through tailored experiences, innovative solutions and quality service to maximize financial results.

 
	

•
	

Growth. Execute a targeted approach to growth to become a premier global omni-channel gaming, hospitality and entertainment company, increasing global brand presence in international markets and through establishing ourselves as a data driven company focused on identifying high value customers, enhancing guest experiences through technology and service, growing brand loyalty and capturing greater market share.

 
	

•
	

Capital allocation. Disciplined investment of cashflows in growth opportunities.

 

In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing properties, spending on strategic developments or initiatives, repaying long-term debt and returning capital to shareholders. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns.

 

We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets, including the ownership, management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities and  accessing new markets for sports and interactive, as well as iGaming and online sports betting. We also leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands

7

 

through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our brands are well-suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.

 

During 2019 and 2020, we delivered on our “MGM 2020 Plan”, a portfolio of improvement initiatives designed to improve the results of our operations, which were primarily comprised of labor, sourcing and revenue programs. We continued to invest in our operating model by expanding the footprint of our Centers of Excellence and enabling best in class operations through adjustments within corporate and property business units. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented several cost cutting initiatives in 2020 that have further improved our operating model and will, together with our MGM 2020 Plan, position us as a stronger company when our business volumes return to 2019 levels. Further detail on these cost reduction efforts can be found elsewhere in this Annual Report Form 10-K.

 

We have continued to focus on our key growth opportunities of developing an integrated resort in Japan and investing in our BetMGM venture. We believe that BetMGM is positioned as a long-term leader in the U.S. online sports betting and iGaming industries with growing market access and market share. As part of our commitment to the success of our BetMGM joint venture, we have integrated our M life program with BetMGM and have BetMGM branded on-property sportsbooks and kiosks to drive higher value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omni-channel strategy.

 

Technology

 

We utilize technology to maximize revenue and to drive efficiency in our operations. Additionally, technology is core to our ability to provide an enhanced customer and employee experience. We believe that digital platforms and customer experiences are critical to differentiation in our marketplace and are critical components to drive growth in our business. Keeping health and safety in mind, we accelerated and reimagined several aspects of the guest experience this year through self-service technology. This includes a newly revamped contactless check-in, which allows guests to complete the check-in process entirely themselves through our mobile app, digital menus, and virtual queues for guests when immediate seating is unavailable or for controlling occupancy at food and beverage outlets, pools and spa, and salon facilities. In addition, we now offer the option of contactless payments across our resort experience and have started piloting mobile order and pay solutions at select owned and operated restaurants. While we have started on this journey, key investments in technology are needed to continue to lay the groundwork for our initial ambition for the MGM 2020 Plan, focused on digital transformation to drive revenue growth.

 

Environmental & Social Responsibility

 

At MGM Resorts we have had a long-standing commitment to environmental and social responsibility. For over a decade, the Company has had a dedicated board committee focused on Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”). In 2019, we bolstered governance of these topics by uniting the key pillars of Diversity and Inclusion, Philanthropy and Community Engagement and Environmental Sustainability under one new, Executive Committee-level leader who manages the Social Impact and Sustainability Center of Excellence, reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President and serves as liaison to the CSR board committee.

 

The Social Impact and Sustainability team stewards our commitment to Focus on What Matters: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet and helps us progress on our fourteen publicly stated 2025 goals. Examples of these goals include Ensure all employees have equal access to leadership opportunities; Donate 5 million meals through our Feeding Forward program; and Reduce carbon emissions per square foot by 45%. The full list of goals and performance against them are available at mgmresorts.com/focused. The content on this website is for informational purposes only and such content is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 

We are committed to aligning disclosures to prevailing Environmental, Social Governance (“ESG”) frameworks. Strategic priorities are mapped to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals where we believe we can most positively impact our stakeholders and the planet. We have submitted to CDP Climate since 2010 and obtained an A- rating in the last two disclosure cycles. As of December 31, 2020, we had achieved the highest score possible (1/10) in both the environmental and social aspects of the Institutional Shareholder Services ESG QualityScore. In addition, we have conducted gap analyses against the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Taskforce for Climate Related Financial Disclosures, and we expect to provide public disclosures against both standards in the future.

 

Each year we strive to make enhancements to our social impact and sustainability program, and in 2020 we completed a formal Materiality Assessment to obtain stakeholder input to inform future changes. Climate change, water and circularity of food and plastics were deemed by stakeholders to be our most material environmental issues, and human capital management and diversity and inclusion were deemed our most material social issues. In line with these findings, we refreshed our environmental strategy in 2020 and we expect to announce additional environmental goals in 2021. We also introduced a refreshed diversity and inclusion strategy with new workforce diversity dashboards for leadership. These take a data-driven approach to work towards providing equal opportunity for female and racial/ ethnically diverse talent within our business units, corporate functions and properties.

 

Finally, given the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, our company dedicated significant resources to mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce and communities. We partnered with the State of Nevada COVID-19 Taskforce to provide product

8

 

sourcing and logistical support for priority healthcare-related needs; supported our employees and their immediate families through the MGM Resorts Foundation Employee Emergency Grant Fund; and, we donated over 500,000 meals to our community partners to help the food insecure.

 

Trademarks

 

Our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Bellagio, The Mirage, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGM Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Beau Rivage and Empire City, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.

 

Human Capital

 

We are focused on fostering a people-driven culture exemplified by how we lead and uphold our core values of teamwork, inclusion, integrity, and excellence, to create an engaged and diverse workforce. Our long-term people strategy is designed to enhance talent attraction and development to support business objectives, guest experience, community engagement, and financial goals.  Our workforce development strategies support local hiring and developing a robust workforce in the local communities in which we operate through veteran support, community training and employment, fulfilling local hiring commitments (where applicable), and through internship and management development programs.

 

Growth and Development

 

We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed, now and in the future, to continue to be a premier employer of choice across the gaming, hospitality, and entertainment industries. We are committed to a culture of continuous learning where employees, at all levels, are engaged in developing their knowledge, skills, and abilities and we support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and professional/personal development. Except as otherwise temporarily impacted due to COVID-19, we offer tuition reimbursement, contribute toward student loan debt repayment, and have partnered with the Nevada System of Higher Education to allow employees to earn a degree online free of charge for all credit hours.

 

Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (“ED&I”)

 

Our approach to ED&I is anchored by our corporate and people strategies and a social impact and sustainability approach that centers on embracing humanity and protecting the planet.  A concise framework lays out four strategic pillars to guide our work:  invest in people; build an inclusive culture; grow business and customer engagement and supplier diversity; and, enhance marketplace leadership and community relations.  As part of our commitment, we have committed to the following four long-range goals: (1) ensure that all employees have equal access to leadership opportunities, (2) spend at least 10% of our biddable procurement with diverse suppliers, (3) expand our Supplier Diversity Mentorship Program to achieve 50 graduates and (4) train 100% of management employees on social impact policies and goals.  In connection with each goal, we have established robust key performance indicators, which are tracked and published in our annual social impact and sustainability report, which is available at https://www.mgmresorts.com/en/company/csr.html. The content on this website is for informational purposes only and such content is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have detailed internal Human Capital workforce reports, which include demographic and diversity data, and are reviewed with the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of the Board, leadership teams and executive management on a regular basis.

 

Internally, we use multiple channels to facilitate communication and to continuously advance our core value of inclusiveness. The channels include but are not limited to open forums with executives, employee engagement surveys with detailed action planning, and employee network groups.

 

Work in the area of equity, diversity and inclusion is advanced through a range of programs and initiatives which include education and training, community partnerships, recruitment and talent development, advocacy and outreach.  Responsibility is driven and led by the Company’s Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and is supported by a centralized diversity and inclusion team and the Human Resources department.

Health, Safety, and Wellness

 

In order to promote our culture of overall employee health and wellness we provide benefits, tools and resources to help maintain or improve physical, mental, and financial health. We continue to align benefit offerings to the needs of a diverse workforce across an expanded regional presence and leverage innovative digital solutions to expand access to health and wellness resources, including the recent additions of virtual maternity coach, depression and anxiety counseling, and diabetic disease management and endocrinology care.

 

To ensure our employees' continued health, safety, and wellness in response to COVID-19, we coordinated with medical experts to put in place extensive protocols for our employees, including screening questions, employee temperature checks, and ongoing training programs on health and safety protocols. As a commitment to our employees impacted by the pandemic, we have maintained benefits eligibility for many employees who were furloughed in 2020 and unable to work enough hours to otherwise qualify. We also extended health coverage for those terminated as a result of the pandemic for varied periods of time following their separation from the Company.

 

Community Engagement and Philanthropy

 

Our philanthropic focus centers around: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet. We organize our major programs and initiatives under the pillars of caring for one another and investing in the community.  We established the MGM Resorts Foundation in 2002 as an engagement opportunity for employees to contribute to charitable causes, which provides two types of grants (1) the Employee Emergency Grant, which benefits our employees, and (2) the Community Grant, which benefits local communities. We endeavor to care for our communities through volunteerism and philanthropy and encourage all of our employees to volunteer through a variety of programs. In addition, we offer opportunities for our employees to give back to their communities, including through programs such as VolunteerREWARDS, which provides employees with opportunities to earn grant money to their charity of choice based on volunteer hours.  

 

Employees and Labor Relations

 

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 35,000 full-time and 7,000 part-time employees domestically (excluding approximately 5,000 and 6,000 furloughed employees, respectively, that are no longer receiving any compensation or benefits from the Company), of which approximately 4,000 and 1,000, respectively, support the Company’s management agreements with CityCenter (each excluding approximately 1,000 furloughed employees). In addition, we had approximately 10,000 employees at MGM China. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 24,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2020 (excluding approximately 10,000 furloughed employees). Collective bargaining agreements covering a number of employee job classifications in our Las Vegas properties are scheduled to expire in the first half of 2021. We anticipate negotiations for successor contracts covering those employees are scheduled to begin in the first and second quarters of 2021. In addition, in our regional properties, successor collective bargaining agreements are scheduled to be negotiated in 2021 for Empire City. Negotiations for first time collective bargaining agreements with several labor organizations were slowed or suspended during 2020. Those have resumed or are expected to resume in the first quarter of 2021. This includes employee bargaining units at MGM National Harbor, MGM Grand Las Vegas, MGM Northfield Park, and the MGM Resorts Operations Contact Center in Las Vegas. As of December 31, 2020, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a labor union and the resorts are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. 

 

Government Regulation and Licensing

 

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.  

 

A more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

 

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities), construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject

10

 

to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.

 

In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations.

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this Form 10-K or our 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be made that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements.

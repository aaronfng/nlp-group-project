Overview 
Accenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and consulting, interactive, technology and operations, with digital capabilities across all of these services. We combine unmatched experience and specialized capabilities across more than 40 industries, which are organized across our five industry groups, together with our culture of innovation. Our approximately 506,000 people serve clients in more than 120 countries to help clients build their digital core, transform their operations, and accelerate revenue growth — creating tangible value across their enterprises at speed and scale. 
      
Accenture serves clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and Growth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). Our geographic markets bring together capabilities from across the organization in Strategy & Consulting, Interactive, Technology and Operations—infusing digital skills and industry and functional expertise throughout—to deliver value to our clients.  Our revenues for fiscal 2020 were
$44.3 billion,
and we employed approximately
506,000 people
as of August 31, 2020. Our revenues are derived primarily from Forbes Global 2000 companies, governments and government agencies. We have 
long-term relationships 
and have partnered with 
97 of our top 100 clients 
in fiscal 2020 for 
> 10 years. 
Effective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through the three geographic markets, which also became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The change was designed to help us better serve our clients and continue to scale our business. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five operating groups, Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources, which we now refer to as our industry groups.  
Under the new growth model, we continue to go to market primarily by industry, leveraging our deep expertise across more than 40 industries. The new model simplified our organizational structure and increased our agility to form multi-service teams to meet client needs rapidly and at scale. It is also accelerating innovation by enabling our teams to move seamlessly between global and local, leveraging our network of more than 100 innovation hubs, our technology expertise and ecosystem relationships, and our global delivery capabilities to drive value for clients.  
During fiscal 2020, we continued to make significant investments—in strategic acquisitions, in research and development in our assets, platforms and solutions, and in attracting and developing talent—to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness in the marketplace. At year-end, we had more than 7,900 patents and pending patent applications worldwide. Our disciplined acquisition strategy, which is an engine to fuel organic growth, is focused on scaling our business in high-growth areas; adding skills and capabilities in new areas; and deepening our industry and functional expertise. In fiscal 2020, we invested more than $1.5 billion across 34 strategic acquisitions.

Our Strategy   
Our growth strategy begins with a focus on what our clients need. Regardless of industry, our clients must transform every aspect of their business to meet the needs of today’s digital world. We are helping our clients use technology to build their digital core to drive enterprise-wide transformation—such as moving them to the cloud and embedding security across the enterprise, by transforming their operations—such as replatforming their ERP systems and through our Operations services and Industry X, and by accelerating their growth—such as through creating omni-channel experiences through Interactive.    
We are uniquely able to deliver this transformation because of our ability to bring applied innovation and deliver 360-degree value for our clients. We define 360-degree value as delivering the financial business case and unique value a client may be seeking, and striving where possible to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity with our diverse teams, reskill our clients’ employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with Accenture and for the customers and employees of our clients.   
We are able to leverage our scale and global footprint, and seamlessly move between global and local, embedding responsible business by design in everything we do. Our strong ecosystem partnerships, together with our assets and platforms, including MyWizard, MyNav and Synops, position Accenture to consistently deliver tangible value for our clients.    
Key enablers of our growth strategy include:    
   
acn-20200831_g2.jpg Our People – As a talent- and innovation-led organization, across our entire business our people have highly specialized skills that drive our differentiation and competitiveness. We are deeply committed to investing in our people to ensure they have opportunities to learn and grow in their careers through their work experience and continued development, training and reskilling, and we have an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity;  
acn-20200831_g3.jpg Our Commitment – We are a purpose driven company, committed to delivering on the promise of technology and human ingenuity. Our culture is underpinned by our core values and Code of Business Ethics which are key drivers of the trust our clients and partners place in us to deliver tangible value and outcomes for them; and  
acn-20200831_g4.gif Our Foundation – The new growth model and our enduring shareholder value creation model are key elements of the foundation that enable us to execute on our growth strategy.  





Geographic Markets
The geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, assemble integrated, multi-service client teams, which typically consist of industry experts, capability specialists and professionals with local market knowledge and experience. The geographic markets have primary responsibility for building and sustaining long-term client relationships; bringing together our expertise and collaborating with the other parts of our business to sell and deliver the full range of our services and capabilities; ensuring client satisfaction; and achieving revenue and profitability objectives.
While we serve clients in locally relevant ways, our global footprint and scale in every major country give us the ability to leverage our experience and talent from around the world to accelerate outcomes for our clients. 
Our three geographic markets are Accenture’s reporting segments. The percent of our revenues represented by each market is shown at right.

Global Delivery Capability
A key differentiator is our global delivery capability, powered by the world’s largest network of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations Centers. This allows us to bring the right talent at the right time to our clients from anywhere in the world—both in physical and virtual working environments—a capability that is particularly crucial as business needs and conditions change rapidly. Our global approach provides scalable innovation; standardized processes, methods and tools; automation and artificial intelligence; industry expertise and specialized capabilities; cost advantages; foreign language fluency; proximity to clients; and time zone advantages—to deliver high-quality solutions. Emphasizing quality, productivity, reduced risk, speed to market and predictability, our global delivery model supports all parts of our business to provide clients with price-competitive services and solutions.

Our innovation experts work with clients across the world to imagine their future, build and co-create innovative business strategies and technology solutions, and then scale those solutions to sustain innovation. We harness our unique intellectual property to deliver these innovation services.

These include our proprietary platforms, software, reusable knowledge capital, and other innovations.

Underpinning our innovation services and our global strength in intellectual property is the Accenture Innovation Architecture, which brings together the diverse capabilities from Accenture Research, Accenture Ventures and Accenture Labs to our Studios, Innovation Centers and Delivery Centers. 


Our research and thought leadership teams help identify market, technology and industry trends. Accenture Ventures partners with and invests in growth-stage companies that create innovative enterprise technologies. Accenture Labs incubate and prototype new concepts through applied research and development projects. The new Technology Incubation Group incubates and applies emerging technology innovation to business architectures, including blockchain, extended reality and quantum. Our network of more than 100 innovation hubs uses those insights and technologies to help clients imagine, build and scale for the future. We believe this combination of talent, assets and capabilities makes Accenture one of the leading strategic innovation partners for our clients.


To protect Accenture’s brands, we rely on intellectual property laws and trademark registrations held around the world. Trademarks appearing in this report are the trademarks or registered trademarks of Accenture Global Services Limited, Accenture Global Solutions Limited, or third parties, as applicable.


Competition
Accenture operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace. We compete with a variety of organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer—but we believe no other company offers the full range of services at scale that Accenture does, which uniquely positions us in a highly competitive market. Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis. 
Our competitors include large multinational IT service providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers; off-shore IT service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India; accounting firms that provide consulting and other IT services and solutions; solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including advertising agencies and technology start-ups; and in-house IT departments of large corporations that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm. 
We believe Accenture competes successfully in the marketplace because:
•We are a trusted partner with long-term client relationships and a proven track record for delivering on large, complex programs that drive tangible value; 
•We provide a broad range of services with our unique approach to bring integrated multi-service teams at scale and have a significant presence in every major geographic market, enabling us to leverage our global expertise in a local context and deliver tangible value; 
•We have deep industry and cross-industry expertise, which enable us to accelerate value as clients transform their products, customer experiences and business operations; 
•The breadth and scale of our technology capabilities, combined with our strong relationships with our technology ecosystem partners, enable us to help clients transform and re-platform in a sustainable way at speed; and 
•Our goal is to recruit the most talented people in our markets, and we have an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity, which creates an environment that unleashes innovation, and a world-class learning organization that helps us continuously invest in the development of our people.

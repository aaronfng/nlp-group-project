Overview

Ulta Beauty is the largest beauty retailer in the United States and the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrance, skin care products, hair care products, and salon services. We provide unmatched product breadth, value, and convenience in a distinctive specialty retail environment. Key aspects of our business include:

Shopping Experience. Our guests can satisfy all of their beauty needs at Ulta Beauty. Our stores, website, and mobile applications offer more than 25,000 products from more than 600 well-established and emerging beauty brands across a variety of categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty’s own private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection. Our bright and open store environment and easy to shop website and mobile applications encourage our guests to discover new products and services. We believe we offer the widest selection of beauty categories, including prestige and mass cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, prestige and mass skincare, bath and body products, professional hair products, and salon styling tools. We also offer a full-service salon in every store featuring hair, skin, makeup, and brow services.

Value Proposition. We believe our focus on delivering a compelling value proposition to our guests across all of our product categories drives guest loyalty. We offer a comprehensive loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, and target communications and promotions through our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. We also offer frequent promotions and coupons, in-store events, and gifts with purchase.

Convenience. Today, we offer guests a variety of ways to shop for beauty, including in our stores, through our mobile applications, and on ulta.com. We also provide convenient fulfillment options including buy online pick-up in store, buy online pickup curbside, ship from store, and ship to home. Our stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power strip centers.  Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. Our store design, fixtures, and open layout provide the flexibility to respond to consumer trends and changes in our merchandising strategy. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 1,264 retail stores across 50 states, as well as an e-commerce website and mobile applications.

We were founded in 1990 as a beauty retailer at a time when prestige, mass, and salon products were sold through distinct channels — department stores for prestige products; drug stores and mass merchandisers for mass products; and salons and authorized retail outlets for professional hair care products. We developed a unique specialty retail concept that offers a broad range of brands and price points, a compelling value proposition, and a convenient and welcoming shopping environment. We define our target consumer as a beauty enthusiast, a consumer who is passionate about the beauty category and has high expectations for the shopping experience. We estimate that beauty enthusiasts represent approximately 57% of shoppers and 77% of spend in the U.S. beauty category.

The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 and our Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our strategy

We target beauty enthusiasts across multiple demographics and shopping behaviors. Beauty enthusiasts have a deep emotional connection with beauty, and historically, this connection has not diminished in softer economic environments. Our proprietary consumer research confirms engagement with the beauty category remains strong, but the unprecedented challenges faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely have sustained effects on the category. Health and safety concerns are elevated, consumers have quickly adopted new shopping behaviors, operating costs are increasing, and many retailers have faced financial challenges, resulting in increased store closures.

Recognizing the impact these changes will have on the beauty category, we intend to leverage the strengths of our operating model and investments to position Ulta Beauty for continued success post-COVID. Specifically, we are focused on accelerating efforts in the following key areas to expand our long-term market share gains and extend our competitive advantages.

Build omnichannel operations that more deeply connects guests across channels. Our guest insights and loyalty program member data confirm that our guests prefer to transact in physical stores, where they can discover and interact with products and other beauty enthusiasts. In addition, our guests are increasingly engaging online to research, discover new products, and purchase. Our omnichannel guests are extremely valuable, spending nearly three times more than retail-only guests. To drive increased guest engagement across all channels, we are leveraging a multifaceted approach to communicate, engage, and transact, and we are expanding our fulfillment capabilities, including buy online and pickup in-store and curbside pickup. Our vision is to offer industry-leading omnichannel experiences that engage our guests and unlock the combined potential of our physical and digital channels.

Reimagine how guests experience and discover Beauty. Beauty enthusiasts value the human connection and the physical experience of beauty. The Ulta Beauty guest experience is differentiated by our broad array of categories, brands, and price points, immersive digital tools, multiple shopping options, high quality services, and friendly, well-trained associates. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased focus on personal safety and impacted how guests test products and experience beauty. As a result, we are reimagining the guest experience and product discovery process and exploring ways technology, services, and the role of our associates can evolve to deliver fun, interactive, easy, and functional experiences for our guests. Our vision is to become the most loved destination for beauty enthusiasts by reimagining the end-to-end guest experience, facilitating inspiration, discovery, and experimentation, and serving as a trusted guide, regardless of channel.

Drive market share growth through the deployment of winning category strategies. Assortment is the center of our value proposition and represents a core differentiator within the market. We engage beauty enthusiasts to discover and play across all categories with an enticing assortment focused on innovation and leading trends, differentiation and exclusivity, and speed to market. We believe our broad selection of merchandise across categories, price points, and brands offer a unique shopping experience for our guests. Guests can find everything they need in one shopping trip with our offering of more than 600 brands, eliminating the need to go to multiple departments stores, specialty stores, salons, drug stores, mass merchandisers, and pure play e-commerce companies that may sell the same or similar products. Because of our broad array of categories, brands, and price points, we appeal to a wide range of consumers of all ages, demographics, and lifestyles. We continue to change our assortment to reflect evolving beauty trends and innovation and to meet our guests’ desire for new products. Our vision is to engage and delight beauty enthusiasts with a curated beauty assortment focused on exclusivity and leading trends.

Deepen Ulta Beauty love and loyalty. We have 30.7 million active Ulta Beauty members enrolled in our Ultamate Rewards loyalty program. Loyalty member transactions represent more than 94% of our annual total net sales, and our data demonstrates that loyalty members shop with higher frequency and spend more per visit as compared to non-members. While recent disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted recent member growth, we believe we can expand Ulta Beauty’s reach, relevancy, and engagement with our guests by evolving the value proposition of our Ultamate Rewards program, increasing total membership in the program, building strategic partnerships that create incremental value for our guests, and using our customer data to deliver personalized member experiences. Our vision is to continue to innovate and integrate the Ultamate Rewards program in meaningful ways and personalize the guest experience across all touchpoints to create stronger member connection, engagement, and loyalty.

Drive holistic cost optimization. Similar to other retailers, we are experiencing cost pressures from macroeconomic trends, including rising wage rates and higher transportation and shipping costs. In addition, we are managing ongoing headwinds from channel and category mix shifts. Through our cost optimization program, Efficiencies For Growth, we are targeting and delivering cost savings in four work streams: category performance improvement, indirect procurement, end-to-end operations, and real estate. As we look forward, we are moving beyond process optimization to develop a cost structure that will enable us to weather future economic challenges while also supporting investments for future growth. Our vision is to deliver profitable growth and competitive advantage by optimizing our cost structure to

enable scale and growth, developing agile operating processes that support rapid testing, learning and implementation, and building new capabilities tailored to win in a rapidly evolving omnichannel world.

Develop our talent and strengthen our culture. Leadership, culture, and engagement of our associates are key drivers of our performance. We have developed and sustained a world-class, guest-centric, values-based, high performance culture. We have an experienced management team that brings a creative merchandising approach and a disciplined operating philosophy to our business. We believe that beauty is for everyone, regardless of age, size, ability, skin tone, culture, or gender. Our vision is to provide an environment where every associate feels they can fully contribute and realize their full potential.

Our market

We operate within the large U.S. beauty products and salon services industry. In 2020, this market represented approximately $150 billion in sales, according to forecasted Euromonitor International and IBIS World Inc. In 2020, the beauty products industry totaled approximately $92 billion and included cosmetics, haircare, fragrance, bath and body, skincare, salon styling tools, and other toiletries. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had only a 7% share of the $92 billion beauty product industry. Within this market, we compete across all major categories as well as a range of price points by offering prestige, mass, and salon products. Our assortment strategy is built to maximize our opportunity in this industry. In 2020, the salon services industry totaled approximately $58 billion and included hair, skin, and nail services. We estimate that Ulta Beauty had less than 1% share of this industry. We have full-service hair salons and skin services in substantially every store and operate brow bars in most of our stores, as well as makeup services through our salons. Due to COVID-19 related restrictions, we were unable to offer skin and makeup services for most of fiscal 2020. We have plans to resume services as soon as it is safe to do so.

Although our business was impacted by temporary store closures due to COVID-19, our research indicates that Ulta Beauty continues to increase market share across most prestige beauty categories in the overall U.S. market. COVID-19 and its various impacts have changed consumer behavior and consumption of beauty products due to the closures of offices, retail stores and other businesses and the significant decline in social gatherings. In addition, beauty cycles are impacted by demographics, trends, and product innovation.  While demographic trends continue to be favorable, we believe a lack of incremental product innovation has resulted in a challenging cycle for the cosmetics category, as innovation brought to the market has not resulted in incremental product purchases. Despite the overall beauty market decline in 2020 due to COVID-19 impacts, we expect the beauty category will return to growth as consumers recover from the impacts of COVID-19, and we remain confident that our differentiated and diverse business model, our commitment to strategic investments, and our highly engaged associates will continue to drive market share gains for Ulta Beauty.

Competition

Our major competitors for prestige and mass products include traditional department stores, specialty stores, drug stores, mass merchandisers, and the online capabilities of national retailers and brands, as well as pure-play e-commerce companies. The market for salon services and products is highly fragmented. Our competitors for salon services and products include chain and independent salons.

Our retail channels

We are committed to meeting guests where and how they want to shop and strive to offer guests a compelling shopping experience through our stores, website, and mobile applications.

Stores. Our retail stores are predominantly located in convenient, high-traffic locations such as power strip centers. Our typical store is approximately 10,000 square feet, including approximately 950 square feet dedicated to our full-service salon. Our retail store concept, including physical layout, displays, lighting, and quality of finishes, has evolved over time to reflect the rising expectations of our guests and to keep pace with our merchandising and operating strategies.

We offer a full range of services in all of our stores, focusing on hair, skin, makeup, and brow services. Our current Ulta Beauty store format includes an open and modern salon area and a skin treatment room or dedicated skin treatment area on the sales floor. In addition, most of our stores offer brow services on the sales floor.  The salon features a concierge desk, approximately five to ten stations, and a shampoo and hair color processing area. We employ highly skilled, licensed professional stylists and estheticians who offer services as well as educational experiences, including consultations, styling lessons, makeup applications, skincare regimens, and at-home care recommendations. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we operated at approximately 50% capacity for salon and brow services and were unable to offer skin and makeup services for most of fiscal 2020. We have plans to resume skin and makeup services as soon as it is safe to do so.  

During our fiscal year ended January 30, 2021 (fiscal 2020), 74% of new stores opened in existing shopping centers and 26% opened in new shopping centers. Almost all new stores were opened in existing markets compared to new markets. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 1,264 stores across 50 states. During the first half of fiscal 2020, new store activity was temporarily paused due to COVID-19. New store openings resumed in the third quarter of fiscal 2020.

In addition to opening new stores, we also remodeled, relocated, or refreshed (in-store fixtures and merchandising upgrades) certain stores, as shown in the following table:

Our real estate vision is to make Ulta Beauty accessible and convenient to more consumers across a variety of markets, a key driver of how we plan to expand our market share over time. We believe that over the long term, we have the potential to grow our store footprint to between 1,500 to 1,700 Ulta Beauty stores in the United States. We plan to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our presence in small markets, and further develop urban markets.

Our rigorous analytical approach to site selection has translated into a high performing real estate portfolio. The average investment required to open a new Ulta Beauty store is approximately $1.4 million, which includes capital investments, net of landlord contributions, pre-opening expenses, and initial inventory, net of payables. Our net investment required to open new stores and the net sales generated by new stores may vary depending on a number of factors, including geographic location.

Digital platform. In addition to store expansion, we continue to expand our digital capabilities. Our e-commerce platform has two key roles: generating direct channel sales and profits by communicating with our guests in an interactive, enjoyable way that reinforces the Ulta Beauty brand; and driving traffic to our stores, website, and native applications. Our omnichannel guests are extremely valuable, historically spending nearly three times as much as retail-only guests. We continue to develop and add new website and mobile features and functionality, marketing programs,

new products and brands, and omnichannel integration points. We intend to establish ourselves as a leading online beauty resource by providing our guests with a rich online experience for information on key trends and products, editorial content, expanded assortments, interactive experiences, including virtual try-on capabilities, and social media content.

We continue to improve our order fulfillment capabilities with increased speed of delivery through existing distribution centers, fast fulfillment centers (e-commerce only), select retail stores, and more efficient processes designed for e-commerce order fulfillment. To support our e-commerce operations, during 2020 we opened the Jacksonville fast fulfillment center, expanded e-commerce operations in the Chambersburg, Greenwood and Dallas distribution centers, and expanded the ship-from-store program to 115 stores. These investments have increased our e-commerce shipping capacity and improved delivery speed to guests.

Our omnichannel capabilities such as “Buy Online, Pick-up in Store” and “Store 2 Door,” which provides the ability for customers to order in-store and have products delivered to their homes, are available in all stores. In response to COVID-related constraints, in fiscal 2020 our digital and store teams launched a new curbside pickup option for guests. We also expanded our store locator functionality to include greater visibility to store specific service offerings, in-store and curbside hours, and to communicate the opening status of local stores. In the Ulta app, we now provide store-specific occupancy levels for greater transparency and guest safety.

Partnerships

In support of our strategic priorities, we have formed a long-term partnership with Target Corporation to create Ulta Beauty at Target, a “shop-in-shop” concept that will offer a limited assortment of established and emerging prestige brands online and in approximately 100 Target locations beginning in the second half of 2021 (with plans to scale to hundreds more over time).

Merchandising

Strategy

We offer one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools. A typical Ulta Beauty store carries more than 25,000 products from more than 600 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty’s own private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection. We present these products in an open-sell environment using centrally produced planograms (detailed schematics showing product placement in the store) and promotional merchandising planners. Our merchandising team continually monitors beauty and fashion trends, historical sales trends, and new product launches to keep Ulta Beauty’s product assortment fresh and relevant and to ensure that our assortment reflects the diversity of our guests. We believe our broad selection of merchandise, from moderate-priced brands to higher-end prestige brands, creates a unique shopping experience for our guests.

Certain beauty enthusiast consumer groups are growing more interested in choosing products that will support their overall health and wellness. These groups are focused on the connection between their own personal well-being and the well-being of workers, animals, communities, and the environment, and they are increasingly supporting brands whose products and actions align with their own values. Reflecting this growing importance of these trends, in fiscal 2020 we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta BeautyTM in all stores, on Ulta.com and on our app. This holistic initiative provides transparency for guests to help them choose brands and products that reflect their personal values and individual needs. Through this initiative, we are certifying brands across four key pillars: Clean Ingredients, Cruelty Free, Vegan, and Sustainable Packaging. We also highlight brands whose philanthropic efforts are critical to their business through the positive impact pillar. Displayed in stores on an endcap constructed of recycled and recyclable materials, the program launched with 187 brands. As of January 30, 2021, more than 230 brands participated in the program, with more than half certified in more than one pillar. As part of the launch, we published our “Made Without List,” an evolving ingredient standard for clean beauty products, and established the Conscious Beauty Advisory Council, a coalition of experts at the forefront of clean beauty, product development, and packaging sustainability. With the help of our

Table of Contents

Advisory Council, we will ensure that Conscious Beauty at Ulta BeautyTM will continue to evolve and grow as expectations and standards for clean beauty continue to change.

We believe our private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection, is a strategically important opportunity for growth and profit contribution. Our objective is to provide quality, trend-right private label products to continue to strengthen our guests’ perception of Ulta Beauty as a contemporary beauty destination. Ulta Beauty manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas that enhance our brand image. The Ulta Beauty Collection has been certified in the Clean Ingredients and Cruelty Free pillars within the Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty™ program. We also offer products such as Tarte Double Duty Beauty cosmetics, IT Brushes for Ulta Beauty, and CHI for Ulta Beauty hair care appliances that are permanently exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Similarly, we offer a number of products that are exclusive for a limited period of time or are offered in advance of our competitors, such as Morphe, Colourpop, Pattern, and Florence. The Ulta Beauty Collection and permanent Ulta Beauty exclusive products represented approximately 5.5% of our total net sales in fiscal 2020. Both permanent and temporary exclusive products represented approximately 13.5% of our total net sales in fiscal 2020.

Categories

We offer a balanced portfolio across five primary categories: (1) cosmetics; (2) skincare, bath, and fragrance; (3) haircare products and styling tools; (4) services; and (5) other, which includes nail products, accessories, other revenue sources such as the private label and co-branded credit card programs, and deferred revenue related to the loyalty program and gift card breakage.

Organization

Our merchandising team consists of a Chief Merchandising Officer who oversees the Senior Vice President of Cosmetics and category Vice Presidents who in turn oversee Divisional Merchandise Managers and their teams of buyers. Our Chief Merchandising Officer also oversees our centralized merchandise planning and forecasting group to ensure consistent execution across our store base and e-commerce platform and our planogram team. Our planogram team assists the merchants and inventory teams to keep new products flowing into stores on a timely basis. All major product categories undergo planogram revisions on a regular basis, and adjustments are made to assortment mix and product placement based on current sales trends.

Our visual team works with our merchandising team to develop strategic placement of promotional merchandise, functional and educational signage, and creative product presentation standards in all of our stores. All stores receive centrally produced promotional merchandising planners to ensure consistent implementation of our marketing programs.

Planning and allocation

We have developed a disciplined approach to buying and a dynamic inventory planning and allocation process to support our merchandising strategy. We centrally manage product replenishment to our stores through our merchandise planning group. This group serves as a strategic partner to, and provides financial oversight of, the merchandising team. The

7

Table of Contents

merchandising team creates a sales forecast by category for the year. Our merchandise planning group creates an open-to-buy plan, approved by senior executives, for each product category. The open-to-buy plan is updated weekly with point-of-sale (POS) data, receipts, and inventory levels and is used throughout the year to balance buying opportunities and inventory return on investment. We believe this structure maximizes our buying opportunities while maintaining organizational and financial control. Regularly replenished products are presented consistently in all stores utilizing a centralized merchandising planogram process. POS data is used to calculate sales forecasts and to determine replenishment levels. We determine promotional product replenishment levels using sales history from similar or comparable events. To ensure our inventory remains productive, our planning and replenishment group, along with senior executives, monitor the levels of clearance and aged inventory in our stores on a weekly basis.

Brand partnerships

We have strong, active relationships with our more than 400 brand partners. Our top ten brand partners, such as Estée Lauder Companies, L’Oréal, and Shiseido among others, represented approximately 56% and 61% of our total net sales in fiscal 2020 and our fiscal year ended February 1, 2020 (fiscal 2019), respectively. We believe our brand partners view us as a significant distribution channel for growth and brand enhancement, and we work closely with them to market both new and existing brands.

All brand partners and respective subcontractors and their facilities are subject to Ulta Vendor Standards, as applicable, which set forth the ethical, legal, social, and workplace standards to meet in order to do business with Ulta Beauty. In addition to complying with Ulta Vendor Standards, many brand partners have committed to help advance our mission to maintain the beauty of our environment and minimize our impact on the world around us by offering sustainable packaging.

Marketing and advertising

We employ a multi-faceted marketing strategy to increase brand awareness, drive traffic to our stores, website, and mobile applications, acquire new loyalty program members, improve guest retention, increase frequency of shopping, and increase spend per member. We communicate with our guests and prospective guests through multiple vehicles, including print advertising, digital and social media, and television and radio. These vehicles highlight the breadth of our selection of prestige, mass and salon beauty products, new products and services, and special offers, as well as build our emotional connection with guests. Our comprehensive public relations strategy enhances Ulta Beauty’s reputation as a beauty destination, increases brand awareness, supports our charitable efforts related to the Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation, and drives awareness of new products, in-store events, and new store openings.

The Ultamate Rewards loyalty program is an important tool to increase retention of existing guests and to enhance their loyalty to the Ulta Beauty brand. Our CRM platform enables sophisticated analysis of the customer data in our loyalty member database as well as greater personalization of our marketing campaigns and day-to-day communications. Our data demonstrates that loyalty members spend more per visit as compared to non-members. The 30.7 million active loyalty program members generated approximately 94% of total net sales in fiscal 2020. Ultamate Rewards enables customers to earn points based on their purchases. Points earned are valid for at least one year and may be redeemed on any product we sell or service we provide. To enhance our loyalty program, we offer co-branded and private label credit cards. The credit cards drive higher wallet share and greater loyalty from our rewards members, provide increased consumer insights, and offer attractive economics. Furthermore, we continue to expand our gift card program to increase distribution to thousands of retailers through partnerships with third parties.

We are directing a growing percentage of our marketing expense towards digital, social media, and streaming advertising. We believe these channels are highly effective in communicating with existing guests, as well as reaching those who have not yet shopped with us. Our marketing program has been effective in communicating with our existing online, mobile, and retail guests in a targeted and relevant way. Our digital marketing strategy includes search engine optimization, paid search, mobile advertising, social media, display advertising, and other digital marketing channels. Digital marketing, coupled with our national TV and radio advertising, has helped us increase brand awareness among those not familiar with Ulta Beauty, which we believe has resulted in new guests.

Staffing and operations

Retail stores

Our current Ulta Beauty store format is typically staffed with a general manager, a services manager, and three associate managers, along with approximately twenty full- and part-time associates, including approximately four to eight prestige consultants and five to ten licensed salon professionals. The management team in each store reports to the general manager. The general manager oversees all store activities including salon management, inventory management, merchandising, cash management, scheduling, hiring, and guest services. Members of store management receive bonuses depending on their position and based upon various performance metrics. Each general manager reports to a District Manager, who in turn reports to a Regional Vice President of Operations, who in turn reports to a Senior Vice President of Stores, who in turn reports to the Chief Store Operations Officer, who in turn reports to the Chief Executive Officer. Each store team receives additional support from time to time from recruiting specialists for the retail and salon operations, regionally based talent development managers, a field loss prevention team, service district educators and service district leaders, and brand partners.

Ulta Beauty stores are open seven days a week, typically eleven hours a day, Monday through Saturday, and seven hours on Sunday. Our stores have extended hours during the holiday season. Due to COVID-19, for most of fiscal 2020 our store hours were shortened, on average, to nine hours a day, Monday through Saturday.   

Salon services

A typical salon is staffed with five to ten licensed salon professionals, including six or more stylists and one or two estheticians. Our most productive salons have a guest coordinator and an assistant manager. Our services district educators and brand partner education classes create a comprehensive educational program for approximately 4,800 Ulta Beauty salon professionals.

Supply chain

Our vision is to develop an expanded and optimized end-to-end supply chain that improves operational efficiency, performance, and guest experience. This includes enhanced systems and processes as well as a modernized distribution center network to support our new store and e-commerce growth. We operate four distribution centers that support both stores and e-commerce demand, and two fast fulfillment centers that support e-commerce only. In addition, 115 stores fulfill e-commerce orders as part of our ship-from-store program.

Inventory is shipped from our suppliers to our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers. We carry more than 25,000 products and replenish our stores with such products primarily in eaches (i.e., less-than-case quantities), which allows us to ship less than an entire case when only one or two of a particular product is required. Our distribution centers and fast fulfillment centers use warehouse management software systems to manage inventory to support product purchase decisions. Product is delivered to stores using a broad network of contract and local pool (final mile) carriers.

Information technology

We are committed to using technology to enhance our competitive position. We depend on a variety of information systems and technologies (including cloud technologies) to maintain and improve our competitive position and to manage the operations of our growing store base. We rely on computer systems to provide information for all areas of our business, including supply chain, merchandising, POS, e-commerce, marketing, finance, accounting, and human resources. Our core business systems consist mostly of purchased software programs that integrate together and with our internally developed software solutions. Our technology also includes a company-wide network that connects all corporate users, stores, and our distribution center infrastructure and provides communications for continual polling of sales and merchandise movement at the store level.

Our Security Operations Center constantly and proactively monitors our network and application landscape for threats and anomalies. We have established processes for sharing data and performing third-party risk assessment and regular

disaster recovery planning and testing. Our security approach also includes multiple layers of defense and testing of controls. All Ulta Beauty associates have a role as stewards of company data, and we educate them on how to keep data safe. As part of our annual Code of Business Conduct training, we train associates on how to keep devices and data safe in public places; how to avoid security threats and phishing scams; how to maintain a secure workplace; and everyday practices that help maintain the security of corporate digital devices, data and systems.

We intend to leverage our technology infrastructure and systems where appropriate to gain operational efficiencies through more effective use of our systems, people, and processes. We update the technology supporting our stores, distribution infrastructure, and corporate headquarters on a regular basis. We will continue to make investments in our information systems to facilitate growth and enhance our competitive position.

The majority of our trademark registrations contain the ULTA mark, including Ulta Beauty and two related designs, Ulta.com and Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance (and design). We maintain our marks and monitor filing deadlines for renewal and continued validity. All marks that are deemed material to our business have been applied for or registered in the United States and select foreign countries, including Canada, Mexico and other countries in Latin America, Europe, and Asia.

We believe our trademarks, especially those related to the Ulta Beauty brand, “All Things Beauty. All In One Place. ®”, “The Possibilities are Beautiful®”, “21 Days of Beauty®”, and “Conscious Beauty at Ulta BeautyTM” have significant value and are important to building brand recognition.

Government regulation

We are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations, and other constraints exist at the federal, state, or local levels in the United States. The products we sell in our stores, such as cosmetics (including cannabidiol products), dietary supplements, food and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, medical devices, and styling tools, including our Ulta Beauty branded products, may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state regulatory agencies, and State Attorneys General (State AGs). Such regulations principally relate to the safety, labeling, manufacturing, advertising, and distribution of the products. In addition, the salon services provided in our stores may be subject to state and local regulations.

Products classified as cosmetics (as defined in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act) are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA, but the products must generally be safe and must be properly manufactured and labeled. Certain products, such as sunscreens and acne treatments, are classified as OTC drugs, and certain ingestible products, such as vitamins and minerals, are classified as dietary supplements. Both OTC drugs and dietary supplements have specific regulatory requirements, including ingredient, labeling, and manufacturing requirements. Products such as wrinkle reducing lights may be classified as medical devices and, in addition to being subject to labeling and manufacturing requirements, may also be subject to premarketing review by the FDA. Finally, products such as styling tools (e.g. blow dryers and curling irons) are regulated by the CPSC, which has strict requirements including the requirement to report certain product defects. The labeling and packaging of all of these products may also be subject to the requirements of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and state specific requirements.

Further, statements we make in advertising, including statements about the safety or efficacy of products, pricing, and environmental claims, are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, which generally prohibit unfair or deceptive practices.

Labor and employment and taxation laws, to which most retailers are typically subject, also impact our day-to-day operations. We are also subject to typical governmental and real estate land use restrictions and typical advertising and consumer protection laws (both federal and state). Our services business is subject to state board regulations and state licensing requirements.

In our store leases, we require our landlords to obtain all necessary governmental approvals and permits for the site to be used as a retail site, and we also ask them to obtain any governmental approvals and permits for our specific use (but at times the responsibility for obtaining governmental approvals and permits for our specific use falls to us). As applicable, we require our landlords to deliver a certificate of occupancy for any work they perform on our buildings or the shopping centers in which our stores are located. If required by the municipality, we are responsible for delivering a certificate of occupancy for any remodeling or build-outs that we perform and are responsible for complying with all applicable laws in connection with such construction projects or build-outs.

Human capital management

We believe our associates, with their combined skills, knowledge, experiences, and commitment to serving our guests, are among our most important resources and are critical to our continued success.

The following table sets forth the approximate number of associates employed as of:

We have no collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any work stoppages. We believe we have good relationships with our associates.

Diversity and inclusion

Our goal is to create an inclusive environment where every associate feels he or she can be his or her authentic self and every guest is optimally served, regardless of differences. A critical way we achieve this is by educating all associates on the lived experiences of their peers and key moments in time that have cultural or heritage significance, as well as the unconscious beliefs and biases that shape our behavior today. We accomplish this through open discussion forums, interactive educational experiences, and opportunities to engage with our communities.

In addition, we aim to ensure that all in-store experiences are equitable, fair, and unbiased. We take action to support this goal by conducting mandatory trainings for in-store associates and providing weekly learning opportunities to focus on guest perspectives and reinforce key takeaways. We offer similar training across the organization to help key decision-makers and associates in their own learning journeys and support our Champion Diversity value and inclusion competency.

Oversight and management

We strive to make sure that our associates are at the heart of every decision we make.  The Chief Human Resources Officer, along with the entire executive team, is responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. This includes the attraction, acquisition, development, and engagement of talent and the design of associate compensation and benefits programs. Our human capital objectives and initiatives, including the risks related to compensation policies and practices, management development and leadership succession, diversity and inclusion

policies and practices, and implementation and compliance monitoring of our Code of Business Conduct, are also overseen by individual Board committees as described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines.

We believe open and honest two-way communication is critical to maintaining strong associate engagement. Our executive team reviews associate engagement and satisfaction surveys to monitor associate engagement and satisfaction with their role, their leader, and the Company as a whole. Our leadership team also hosts roundtable sessions to dive deeper on specific topics as well as additional forums, including department town halls, store and distribution center visits, and other small group gatherings.

Training and development

Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified associates at all levels of the organization. We are committed to continually developing our associates and providing career advancement opportunities. Our associates and management teams are essential to our store expansion strategy. We use a combination of existing managers, promoted associates, and outside hires to support our new stores. The majority of our promotions are internal. As we continue to promote and develop from within, we are building a bench of associates and leaders who know our company inside and out.

All of our associates participate in an interactive new-hire orientation through which each associate becomes acquainted with Ulta Beauty’s mission, vision, and values. Through our learning management system and our digital workplace system, we provide continuing education to associates throughout their careers at Ulta Beauty. Additionally, our leadership development program prepares promising future leaders for new levels of responsibility.

Compensation and benefits

Our commitment to our associates and their well-being is one of our highest priorities. We have assembled a suite of benefits that affirms and supports all that our associates contribute every day, including:

●	Health care coverage is offered to those who work more than 30 hours a week in any position. Coverage extends to eligible dependents, including spouses, same-sex partners and children under the age of 26. We offer comprehensive medical plans that empower associates to choose the coverage that best suits them.
●	401(k) plan with up to a 4% company match.
●	Disability and life insurance.
●	Company-paid short-term disability pay at 80% of pay.
●	Additional insurance options, including legal, pet, home, and auto.
●	Tuition reimbursement program.
●	Paid time off, including an extended illness bank.
●	Discounts on retail products and salon services.
In addition, we believe wellness, like beauty, is more than skin deep, so we offer mental health resources, such as counseling services and access to apps; financial wellness planning and guidance; and health apps and educational resources for soon-to-be parents.

Since 2017, the Ulta Beauty Charitable Foundation (UBCF) has supported the Associate Relief Program to assist associates facing unforeseen financial hardship. The Associate Relief Program provides short-term financial support to pay off medical bills or support temporary housing. During 2020, we expanded the criteria for receiving funding to include those in need of extra assistance as a result of COVID-19.

Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuation. Significant portions of our net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. To a lesser extent, our business is also affected by Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day.

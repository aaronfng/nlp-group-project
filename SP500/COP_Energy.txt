SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
 
We manage our operations through six operating segments, defined by geographic 
region: Alaska; Lower 48;
Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; 
Asia Pacific; 
and Other International. 
Effective with the third
quarter of 2020, we restructured our segments 
to align with changes to our internal organization. 
The Middle
East business was realigned from the Asia Pacific 
and Middle East segment to the Europe and North 
Africa segment. 
The segments have been renamed the Asia 
Pacific segment and the Europe, Middle East 
and
North Africa segment. 
We have revised segment information disclosures and segment performance metrics
presented within our results of operations for the current 
and prior years. 
For operating segment and
geographic information, see Note 24—Segment 
Disclosures and Related Information, in the Notes 
to
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
We explore for, produce, transport and market crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, LNG and NGLs on 
a worldwide
basis. 
At December 31, 2020, our operations were 
producing in the U.S., Norway, Canada, Australia, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, Libya, China and Qatar.

Total production, including Libya, of 1,127 MBOED decreased 221 MBOED or 16 
percent in 2020 compared
with 2019, primarily due to:
 
●
 
Normal field decline.
●
 
The divestiture of our U.K. assets in the third 
quarter of 2019 and our Australia-West assets in the
second quarter of 2020.
●
 
Production curtailments of approximately 80 MBOED, 
primarily from North American operated
assets and Malaysia.
●
 
Lower production in Libya due to the forced shutdown 
of the Es Sider export terminal and other
eastern export terminals after a period of civil unrest.
 
The decrease in production during 2020 was partly 
offset by:
 
●
 
New wells online in the Lower 48, Canada, 
Norway, Alaska and China.
 
Production excluding Libya for 2020 was 1,118 MBOED. 
Adjusting for estimated curtailments 
of
approximately 80 MBOED; closed acquisitions 
and dispositions; 
and excluding Libya, production for 2020
would have been 1,176 MBOED, a decrease of 15 
MBOED compared with 2019 production. 
This decrease
was primarily due to normal field decline, partly 
offset by new wells online in the Lower 48, Canada, 
Norway,
Alaska and China. 
Production from Libya averaged 
9 MBOED as it was in force majeure during 
a significant
portion of the year.
 
Our worldwide annual average realized price decreased 
34 percent from $48.78 per BOE in 2019 
to $32.15 per
BOE in 2020 primarily due to lower realized crude 
oil, natural gas and bitumen prices. 
Our worldwide annual
average crude oil price decreased 35 percent, from 
$60.99 per barrel in 2019 
to $39.54 per barrel in 2020. 
Our
worldwide annual average natural gas price decreased 
32 percent, from $5.03 per MCF in 2019 to $3.41 
per
MCF in 2020. 
Average annual bitumen prices decreased 75 percent, from $31.72 per barrel in 2019 to 
$8.02
per barrel in 2020.
 
 
ALASKA
 
The Alaska segment primarily explores for, produces, transports 
and markets crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. 
We are the largest crude oil producer in Alaska and have major ownership interests in 
two of North America’s
largest oil fields located on Alaska’s North Slope: Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk. 
We also have a 100 percent
interest in the Alpine Field, located on the Western North Slope. 
Additionally, we are one of Alaska’s largest
owners of state, federal and fee exploration leases, 
with approximately 1.3 million net undeveloped 
acres at
year-end 2020. 
Alaska operations contributed 28 percent 
of our consolidated liquids production and 1 percent
of our consolidated natural gas production.

Greater Prudhoe Area
The Greater Prudhoe Area includes the Prudhoe 
Bay Field and five satellite fields, as well as the 
Greater Point
McIntyre Area fields. 
Prudhoe Bay, the largest oil field on Alaska’s North Slope, is the site of a large
waterflood and enhanced oil recovery operation, 
as well as a gas plant which processes 
natural gas to recover
 
 
 
 
 
5
NGLs before reinjection into the reservoir. 
Prudhoe Bay’s satellites are Aurora, Borealis, Polaris, Midnight
Sun and Orion, while the Point McIntyre, 
Niakuk, Raven, Lisburne and North Prudhoe Bay 
State fields are
part of the Greater Point McIntyre Area. 
 
In 2020, development activity included both rotary 
and coiled-tubing drilling through April, 
resulting in ten
wells drilled and brought online. 
In response to the oil price collapse, the second 
half of 2020 saw a reduction
in rig activity. 
Average net production increased from 81 
MBOED in 2019 to 84 MBOED in 2020. 
 
Greater Kuparuk Area
We operate the Greater Kuparuk Area, which consists of the Kuparuk Field and four 
satellite fields: Tarn,
Tabasco, Meltwater and West Sak. 
Kuparuk is located 40 miles west of the Prudhoe 
Bay Field. 
Field
installations include three central production facilities 
which separate oil, natural gas and water, as well as a
seawater treatment plant. 
Development drilling at Kuparuk consists of 
rotary-drilled wells and horizontal
multi-laterals from existing well bores utilizing 
coiled-tubing drilling.
 
We operated both a rotary and a coiled-tubing drilling rig in the first half of 
2020, resulting in seven operated
wells drilled and brought online in 2020. 
In response to the oil price collapse, the second 
half of 2020 saw a
reduction in rig activity. 
Average net production decreased from 86 MBOED in 2019 to 74 MBOED in 
2020. 
 
Western North Slope
On the Western North Slope, we operate the Colville River Unit, which includes the 
Alpine Field and three
satellite fields: Nanuq, Fiord and Qannik. 
The Alpine Field is located 34 miles west of 
the Kuparuk Field. 
In
2020, an extended-reach drilling rig was delivered 
to the Alpine CD2 drillsite. 
This rig is North America’s
largest mobile land rig and is expected to commence 
drilling operations in 2021. 
 
The Greater Mooses Tooth Unit is the first unit established entirely within the 
NPR-A. 
In 2017, we began
construction in the unit with two drill sites; 
Greater Mooses Tooth #1 (GMT-1) and Greater Mooses Tooth 
#2
(GMT-2). 
GMT-1 achieved first oil in 2018 and completed drilling in 2019. 
In 2020, the second of three
construction seasons for GMT-2 was completed and drilling operations are expected to commence 
in 2021
with first oil later in the year. 
 
We operated both a rotary and a coiled-tubing drilling rig in the Western North Slope during 2020, resulting in
five operated wells drilled and brought online. 
In response to the oil price collapse, the 
second half of 2020
saw a reduction in rig activity. 
Average net production decreased from 51 MBOED in 2019 to 40 MBOED in
2020.
 
Production Curtailments
In response to the oil price collapse that began in 
early 2020, 
we curtailed operated production—in the Greater
Kuparuk Area and Western North Slope—by 8 MBOED in 2020. 
For more information related to the 2020
industry downturn and our response, please see Item 
7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Alaska North Slope Gas
In 2016, we, along with affiliates of Exxon Mobil Corporation, 
BP p.l.c. and Alaska Gasline Development
Corporation (AGDC), a state-owned corporation, 
completed preliminary FEED technical 
work for a potential
LNG project which would liquefy and export natural 
gas from Alaska’s North Slope and deliver it to market. 
In 2016, we, along with the affiliates of ExxonMobil and 
BP, 
indicated our intention not to progress into 
the
next phase of the project due to changes in 
the economic environment, however, AGDC decided to continue 
on
its own, focusing primarily on permitting efforts. 
Currently, AGDC is in the process of seeking new sponsors
for the project. 
Given current market conditions, we no longer believe 
the project will advance and since there
is no current market, 
we recorded a before-tax impairment of $841 million 
for the entire associated carrying
value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs 
and an equity method investment related 
to our Alaska North
Slope Gas asset. 
We remain willing to sell our Alaska North Slope Gas to interested parties on a competitive
basis if a market materializes in the future. 
For additional information related to this 
impairment, See Note
7—Suspended Wells and Exploration Expenses, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements.

Exploration
Appraisal of the Willow Discovery in the Bear Tooth Unit in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A)
continued with the drilling of two of four planned 
appraisal wells before the early cancellation 
of the 2020
program as part of our COVID-19 response. 
The reduced 2020 appraisal program consisted 
of drilling a
horizontal well in the eastern portion of the field, 
informing the reservoir’s connectivity, 
and a vertical well in
the field’s southern extent, reducing the original oil in place uncertainty. 
The initial development plan for the
Willow Discovery, approved in the fourth quarter, does not include the Cassin Discovery from 2013; therefore,
we recognized dry hole expense for two previously 
suspended Cassin wells in 2020.
 
In 2020, exploration of the Harpoon Complex—Harpoon, 
Lower Harpoon and West Harpoon—commenced. 
One exploration well of a planned three-well program 
was drilled before the early cancellation 
of our 2020
winter drilling season in response to COVID-19. 
The well was expensed as a dry hole after 
evaluations
confirmed the well intersected sub-commercial 
volumes of hydrocarbons 
in the upper Harpoon interval which
will not be developed. 
Future exploration plans include returning 
to the Harpoon Complex to explore the
remaining potential. 
 
In late 2018, we commenced appraisal of the 
Putu Discovery with a long-reach well from 
existing Alpine CD4
infrastructure. 
In 2019 and 2020 the long reach CD4 appraisal 
and supporting injector well finished drilling
and testing. Production and injectivity tests 
confirmed development and waterflood feasibility 
of the reservoir.
The project transitioned from appraisal to development 
in early 2020. 
Development planning is ongoing. 
 
A 3-D 
seismic survey was completed in 2020 over 
a 234-mile area on state and federal 
lands. 
We are currently
evaluating this seismic data for future exploration 
opportunities. 
 
Transportation
We transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile
pipeline that is part of Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS). 
We have a 29.5 
percent ownership interest in
TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and 
Oliktok pipelines on the
North Slope.
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope
production, using five company-owned, double-hulled 
tankers, 
and charters third-party vessels as necessary. 
The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, 
primarily to refineries on the west coast of 
the U.S.

LOWER 48
 
On January 15, 
2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho. 
This transaction significantly increases our
Permian position by adding complementary acreage 
across the Delaware and Midland basins. 
The production
and acreage figures and the property descriptions 
below do not reflect this recently closed acquisition. 
For
additional information related to this acquisition, 
see Note 25—Acquisition of Concho Resources 
Inc., in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
The Lower 48 segment consists of operations located 
in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico. 
Organized into the Gulf Coast and Great Plains business 
units, at year-end 2020 we held 10.1 million net
onshore and offshore acres, with a portfolio of low cost of 
supply, shorter cycle time, resource-rich
unconventional plays, and conventional production 
from legacy assets. 
Based on 2020 production volumes,
the Lower 48 is the company’s largest segment and contributed 40 percent of our 
consolidated liquids
production and 44 percent of our consolidated 
natural gas production.

Onshore
At December 31, 2020, we held 10.1 million 
net acres of onshore conventional and unconventional 
acreage in
the Lower 48, the majority of which is either held 
by production or owned by the company. 
Our
unconventional holdings total approximately 
1.3 million net acres in the following areas: 
 
●
 
610,000 net acres in the Bakken, located in 
North Dakota and eastern Montana. 
●
 
200,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford, located in South 
Texas. 
●
 
170,000 net acres in the Permian, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.
●
 
300,000 net acres in other areas with unconventional 
potential.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8
In response to the oil price collapse that began 
in early 2020, we curtailed production 
in the Lower 48 by
approximately 55 MBOED in 2020. 
For more information related to the 2020 industry 
downturn and our
response, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of
Operations. 
These production curtailments contributed to 
lower production in 2020 compared with 
2019 from
our three focus areas:
 
●
 
Eagle Ford—We operated five rigs on average in the Eagle Ford during 2020, 
resulting in 154
operated wells drilled and 71 operated wells brought 
online. 
Production decreased 14 percent in 2020
compared with 2019, averaging 186 MBOED and 
216 MBOED, respectively. 
●
 
Bakken—We operated an average of two rigs during the year in the Bakken and participated 
in
additional development activities operated by co-venturers. 
We continued our pad drilling with 57
operated wells drilled during the year and 29 
operated wells brought online. 
Production decreased 20
percent in 2020 compared with 2019, averaging 
78 MBOED and 97 MBOED, respectively. 
●
 
Permian Basin—The Permian Basin is a combination 
of legacy conventional and unconventional
assets. 
We operated one rig during the full year and another rig during parts of the year 
in the Permian
Basin, resulting in 16 operated wells drilled and 
16 operated wells brought online. 
Production
decreased 1 percent in 2020 compared with 2019, 
averaging 85 MBOED and 86 MBOED,
respectively.
 
Gulf of Mexico
At year-end 2020, 
our portfolio of producing properties in 
the Gulf of Mexico totaled approximately 60,000
net acres. 
A majority of the production consists 
of three fields operated by co-venturers:
 
●
 
15.9 percent interest in the unitized Ursa Field 
located in the Mississippi Canyon Area.
●
 
15.9 percent interest in the Princess Field, a northern 
subsalt extension of the Ursa Field.
●
 
12.4 percent interest in the unitized K2 Field, 
comprised of seven blocks in the Green Canyon 
Area.
 
Dispositions
In the first quarter of 2020, we completed the sale 
of our Waddell Ranch interests in the Permian Basin and our
Niobrara interests. 
Production from these dispositions was immaterial 
to the Lower 48 segment in 2020. 
For
additional information on these transactions, 
see Note 4—Asset Acquisitions and Dispositions, 
in the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Facilities
 
●
 
Lost Cabin Gas Plant—We operate and own a 60 percent interest in the Lost Cabin 
Gas Plant, a 246
MMCFD capacity natural gas processing facility 
in Lysite, Wyoming. 
The plant is currently operating at
less than capacity due to a fire in December 2018. 
Restoration efforts are ongoing and anticipated to be
completed in the first half of 2021. 
The expected production loss in 2021 
is immaterial to the segment.
●
 
Helena Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own the Helena Condensate 
Processing Facility,
a 110 MBD condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas.
●
 
Sugarloaf Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own an 87.5 percent interest 
in the Sugarloaf
Condensate Processing Facility, a 30 MBD condensate processing plant located 
near Pawnee, Texas.
●
 
Bordovsky Condensate Processing Facility—We operate and own the Bordovsky Condensate 
Processing
Facility, a 15 MBD condensate processing plant located in Kenedy, Texas. 
This facility is currently being
decommissioned.

Surmont
Our bitumen resources in Canada are produced 
via an enhanced thermal oil recovery method 
called SAGD,
whereby steam is injected into the reservoir, effectively liquefying the heavy 
bitumen, which is recovered and
pumped to the surface for further processing. 
We hold approximately 600,000 net acres of land in the
Athabasca Region of northeastern Alberta.
 
The Surmont oil sands leases are located approximately 
35 miles south of Fort McMurray, Alberta. 
Surmont
is a 50/50 joint venture with Total S.A. that offers long-lived, sustained production. 
We are focused on
structurally lowering costs, reducing GHG intensity 
and optimizing asset performance. 
 
In response to the oil price collapse that began 
in early 2020, we voluntarily curtailed 
production at Surmont
by approximately 12 MBOED in 2020. 
For more information related to the 2020 industry 
downturn and our
response, please see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of
Operations.
 
Montney
In August 2020, we completed the acquisition 
of additional Montney acreage from Kelt Exploration. 
This
acquisition consisted primarily of undeveloped 
properties, including 140,000 net acres in the 
liquids-rich Inga
Fireweed asset Montney zone, which is directly 
adjacent to our existing Montney position. 
We now hold
approximately 300,000 net acres in the Montney 
play with a 100 percent working interest. 
For additional
information related to the Kelt Exploration acquisition, 
please see Note 4—Acquisitions and Dispositions, 
in
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Following the completion of third-party offtake facilities, 
our newly commissioned processing facility 
and
production from our 2019 drilling program 
came online in February 2020. 
In 2020, development activity
consisted of drilling 14 horizontal wells and completing 
18 wells. 
Overall, 23 wells came online in 2020. 
In
2021, appraisal drilling and completions activity 
will continue to further explore the area’s resource potential.
 
Exploration
 
Our primary exploration focus is assessing our 
Montney acreage. 
Additionally, we have exploration acreage in
the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort Sea Region and 
the Arctic Islands.

200 miles offshore Stavanger, Norway, in the North Sea,
and comprises four producing fields: Ekofisk, Eldfisk, 
Embla and Tor. 
The Tor II redevelopment achieved
first production in December 2020. 
Crude oil is exported to Teesside, England, and the natural gas is exported
to Emden, Germany. 
The Ekofisk and Eldfisk fields consist 
of several production platforms and facilities,
with development drilling continuing over the 
coming years.
 
The Heidrun Field is located in the Norwegian 
Sea. 
Produced crude oil is stored in a floating 
storage unit and
exported via shuttle tankers. 
Part of the natural gas is currently injected into 
the reservoir for optimization of
crude oil production, 
some gas is transported for use as feedstock in 
a methanol plant in Norway, in which we
own an 18 percent interest, 
and the remainder is transported to Europe 
via gas processing terminals in Norway.
 
Aasta Hansteen is a gas and condensate field located 
in the Norwegian Sea. 
Produced condensate is loaded
onto shuttle tankers and transported to market. 
Gas is transported through the Polarled gas pipeline 
to the
onshore Nyhamna processing plant for final processing 
prior to export to market.
 
The Troll Field lies in the northern part of the North Sea and consists 
of the Troll A, B and C platforms. 
The
natural gas from Troll A is transported to Kollsnes, Norway. 
Crude oil from floating platforms Troll B and
Troll C is transported to Mongstad, Norway, for storage and export.
 
The Alvheim Field is located in the northern part of 
the North Sea near the border with the 
U.K. sector, and
consists of a FPSO vessel and subsea installations. 
Produced crude oil is exported via shuttle 
tankers, and
natural gas is transported to the Scottish Area 
Gas Evacuation (SAGE) Terminal at St. Fergus, Scotland,
through the SAGE Pipeline.
 
Visund is an oil and gas field located in the North Sea and consists of a floating 
drilling, production and
processing unit, and subsea installations. 
Crude oil is transported by pipeline to a nearby 
third-party field for
storage and export via tankers. 
The natural gas is transported to a gas processing 
plant at Kollsnes, Norway,
through the Gassled transportation system.
 
We also have varying ownership interests in two other producing fields in the Norway 
sector of the North Sea.

Exploration
 
A well we participated in during 2019, Canela, 
was expensed as a dry hole in 2020 after post 
drill analysis. 
 
In 2020, we completed the third well of a three-well 
operated exploration campaign in Block 25/7 
in the North
Sea with the Hasselbaink Well. 
The Hasselbaink Well encountered insufficient hydrocarbons and was
expensed as a dry hole in 2020. 
In the second half of 2020 we completed 
a two-well operated exploration
campaign in the Norwegian Sea with the Warka and Slagugle wells. 
Both the Warka and Slagugle wells
encountered hydrocarbons and will be evaluated 
for future appraisal programs.
 
We were awarded three new exploration licenses; PL1045, PL1047 and PL1064; and two 
acreage additions,
PL917B and PL1009B. 
Additionally, we exchanged our interest in the PL938 exploration license for
increased interest in the PL1047 exploration 
license.
 
Transportation
We own a 35.1 percent interest in the Norpipe Oil Pipeline System, a 220-mile pipeline 
which carries crude oil
from Ekofisk to a crude oil stabilization 
and NGLs processing facility in Teesside, England.
 
Facilities
We operate and have a 40.25 percent ownership interest in an oil terminal at Teesside, England to support our
Norway operations.

Our production operations in Libya and related 
oil exports have periodically been interrupted over
the last several years due to the shutdown of the 
Es Sider crude oil export terminal. 
In 2020, we had five crude
liftings from Es Sider, compared with 19 crude liftings from Es Sider 
in 2019. 
Production ceased in February
2020, due to a forced shutdown of the Es

Under these terms, we retain a majority 
interest and continue as operator for at least 
three years
after 2023 and retain a participating interest 
until 2043.
 
Exploration
 
We entered into the Central Kalimantan Kualakurun Block PSC in 2015 with an exploration 
period of six
years. 
We completed the firm working commitment program in 2017, which included 
satellite mapping 
and a
740-kilometer 2-D seismic acquisition program. 
After completion of prospect evaluation, both 
PSC
contractors decided to relinquish rights and return 
this block to the government.

We have varying stages of exploration, development and production activities across 
1.5 million net acres in
Malaysia, with working interests in five PSCs. 
Three of these PSCs are located in waters 
off the eastern
Malaysian state of Sabah: Block G, Block J and 
the Kebabangan Cluster (KBBC). 
We operate two exploration
blocks, Block WL4-00 and SK304 in waters 
off the eastern Malaysian state of Sarawak.

Block J
Gumusut
We currently have a 29 percent working interest in the Gumusut Field following the 
redetermination of the
Block J and Block K Malaysia Unit in 2017. 
Gumusut Phase 2 first oil was achieved in 
2019. 
Development
drilling associated with Gumusut Phase 3 is 
planned to commence in the fourth quarter 
of 2021 with the first
of four planned wells. 
First oil is anticipated in 2022.
 
KBBC
The KBBC PSC grants us a 30 percent working 
interest in the KBB, Kamunsu East and Kamunsu 
East
Upthrown Canyon gas and condensate fields. 
In 2020, we recognized dry hole expense 
and impaired the
associated carrying value of unproved properties 
in the Kamunsu East Field that is no longer 
in our
development plans. 
 
KBB
During 2019, KBB tied-in to a nearby third-party floating 
LNG vessel which provided increased gas offtake
capacity. 
Production from the field has been reduced 
since January 2020, due to the rupture 
of a third-party
pipeline which carries gas production from 
KBB to market. 
The pipeline operator has initiated repairs 
with no
production expected to flow through the full length 
of the pipeline during 2021. 
 
Block G
Malikai
We hold a 35 percent working interest in Malikai. 
This field achieved first production in December 2016 
via
the Malikai Tension Leg Platform, ramping to peak production in 2018. 
The KMU-1 exploration well was
completed and started producing through the Malikai 
platform in 2018. 
Malikai Phase 2 development, 
a six-
well drilling campaign, commenced in 2020, with 
first oil anticipated in 2021.
 
Siakap North-Petai
We hold a 21 percent working interest in the unitized Siakap North-Petai (SNP) oil 
field. 
First oil from SNP
Phase 2, a four-well program, is anticipated in the 
fourth quarter of 2021.
 
Production Curtailments
We experienced production curtailments of 4 MBOED in 2020.
 
 
Exploration
In 2017, we were awarded operatorship and a 
50 percent working interest in Block WL4-00, 
which included
the existing Salam-1 oil discovery and encompassed 
0.6 million gross acres. 
In 2018 and 2019, two
exploration and two appraisal wells were drilled, 
resulting in oil discoveries under evaluation 
at Salam and
Benum, while two Patawali wells were expensed 
as dry holes in 2019. 
Further exploration drilling is planned
for 2021. 
 
In 2018, we were awarded a 50 percent working 
interest and operatorship of Block SK304 encompassing 
2.1
million gross acres offshore Sarawak. 
We acquired 
3-D seismic over the acreage and completed 
processing of
this data in 2019. 
Exploration drilling is planned for 2021.
 
In June 2020, we relinquished our 50 percent interest 
in Block SK 313, a 1.4 million gross-acre exploration
block offshore Sarawak.
 
 
OTHER INTERNATIONAL
 
The Other International segment includes exploration 
activities in Colombia and Argentina and contingencies
associated with prior operations in other countries. 
As a result of our completed Concho acquisition 
on
January 15, 2021, we refocused our exploration 
program and announced our intent to pursue a managed 
exit
from certain areas.
 
 
 
 
16
Colombia
We have an 80 percent operated interest in the Middle Magdalena Basin Block 
VMM-3. 
The block extends
over approximately 67,000 net acres and contains 
the Picoplata-1 Well, 
which completed drilling in 2015 and
testing in 2017. 
Plug and abandonment activity started during 
2018 and completed in 2019. 
In addition, we
have an 80 percent working interest in the VMM-2 
Block which extends over approximately 58,000 
net acres
and is contiguous to the VMM-3 Block. 
As part of a case brought forward by environmental 
groups, the
Highest Administrative Court granted a preliminary 
injunction temporarily suspending hydraulic fracturing
activities until the substance of the case is decided. 
As a result, we filed two separate Force Majeure requests
before the relevant authority for both blocks, which 
were granted. 
We 
have no immediate plans to perform
under existing contracts, therefore, the Picoplata-1 
Well was recorded to dry hole expense and we fully
impaired the capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs 
associated with our Colombia assets 
during 2020.
 
Chile 
In September 2020, 
we notified the operator of our decision to exit 
our 49 percent interest in the Coiron Block,
located in the Magallanes Basin in southern Chile. 
We are working with local authorities to finalize our
withdrawal from this block.
 
Argentina
We have a 50 percent nonoperated interest in El Turbio Este Block, within the Austral Basin in southern
Argentina. 
Following the acquisition and processing of 3-D 
seismic covering approximately 500 square 
miles
in 2019, planned activities in 2020 were delayed 
due to the impact of COVID-19 and force majeure 
in the
block.
 
We have a 50 percent non-operated interest in the Bandurria Norte and Aguada Federal 
blocks within the
Neuquen Basin in central Argentina. 
Following a successful production test of two 
horizontal wells on the
Aguada Federal Block, 
we increased our interest from 45 to 50 percent 
in April 2020 where two horizontal
wells continued production testing throughout the 
year. 
Preparation for a 2021 work program is ongoing.

and externally. In particular, we believe a safe organization is a
successful organization, so we prioritize personal and 
process safety across the company. Our SPIRIT Values
are a source of pride. Our day-to-day work is guided 
by the principles of accountability and performance,
which means the way we do our work is as important 
as the results we deliver. We believe these core values
and principles set us apart, align our workforce 
and provide a foundation for our culture.
 
Our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and our Board of Directors play a key role in setting our human capital
management philosophies and tracking our progress. 
The ELT and Board of Directors engage often on
workforce-related topics. Our human capital 
management programs are overseen and administered 
by our
human resources function with support from 
business leaders across the company.
 
We depend on our workforce to successfully execute our company’s strategy and we recognize the importance
of creating a workplace in which our people feel valued. 
We take a broad view of human capital management
that begins with offering a compelling culture and includes 
programs and processes necessary for ensuring 
we
have an engaged workforce with the skills 
to meet our business needs. The key elements 
of our human capital
management are described below.
 
COVID-19 Response
 
In 2020, a significant effort was undertaken to address the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the very early
stages of the pandemic, we adopted and embraced 
three company-wide priorities to guide our activities 
in the
midst of COVID-19: to protect our employees, mitigate 
the spread of COVID-19 and safely run the business. 
We have pursued these priorities via a coordinated crisis management support team, 
frequent workforce
communications and flexible programs to suit 
the challenging environment. 
We transitioned to a remote work
environment for periods of time to ensure the safety 
of our employees, partners and the community, and then
implemented rigorous cleaning and disinfecting 
processes and rigorous mitigation protocols 
to keep our
workforce safe, including temperature scans, social 
distancing, face covering requirements 
and increased
sanitation as employees returned to the office setting.

Culture of Feedback and Engagement
 
Our human capital management approach recognizes 
that a compelling culture and an engaged workforce 
are
powerful determinants of business success. 
Beginning in 2019, we launched a coordinated, multi-year, global
employee feedback program called “Perspectives.” 
In mid-2019 we administered our first 
Perspectives survey,
which received an 86 percent employee response 
rate and yielded more than 35,000 comments. 
We achieved
an employee satisfaction score that, on a 100-point 
scale, was 5 points higher than general industry 
and 11
points higher than our energy peers who used the same platform. 
Importantly, the quantitative and qualitative
survey data were used by leaders across the company 
to identify and analyze relative strengths 
and gaps and to
develop action plans to address gaps.
 
We intended to repeat the comprehensive Perspectives survey in 2020; however, in light of the COVID-19
pandemic and the significant industry downturn, 
we elected to defer the full survey until 
2021 and instead
focused our 2020 feedback program on the specific 
topic of Diversity and Inclusion (D&I). 
The survey
“Perspectives Pulse: D&I” also received a high 
response rate with over 10,000 comments. 
The ELT and an
internal D&I Council are responsible for analyzing 
the survey data to identify D&I strengths 
and gaps, and to
use the findings to establish 2021 D&I priorities 
and action plans. 
The company’s D&I commitment, activities
and programs are described below.
 
Diversity and Inclusion
 
Our commitment to D&I is foundational to our SPIRIT 
Values 
and our stated company-wide D&I goal is 
to
have “a diverse culture of belonging where everyone 
feels valued.” 
We believe a diverse workforce and an
inclusive environment that reflects different backgrounds, 
experiences, ideas and perspectives drives
innovation, employee satisfaction and overall 
company performance. 
We hold our entire workforce
accountable for creating and sustaining an inclusive 
work environment. 
Our leaders are accountable for
having personal D&I goals each year and we believe 
senior leadership involvement is critical 
for achieving
meaningful progress on D&I. 
 
The ELT has ultimate accountability for advancing our D&I commitment through a governance 
structure that
includes an ELT-level D&I Champion, a global D&I Council consisting of senior leaders 
from across the
company and organization-wide D&I goals. 
Leaders meet regularly with each other and 
with the workforce to
discuss challenges, opportunities, best practices 
and progress. 
In addition, our D&I plans and progress are
reviewed regularly with the Board of Directors.
 
In 2018, the company established three pillars 
to guide our D&I activities: leadership accountability, employee
awareness, and processes and programs. 
Since then, we have established corporate priorities 
annually under
each of these areas. 
In 2020 we also published our first D&I 
Annual Report internally and we expect to update
this report periodically as an important part 
of holding ourselves accountable for progressing 
our D&I goals
throughout ConocoPhillips. 
Some of our key D&I actions and accomplishments 
over the past few years
include:
 
●
 
Publishing our first D&I Dashboards internally 
which contain key D&I statistics for our 
global and
U.S. employees at year-end for the periods 2015-2019;
●
 
Launching a company-wide platform for our workforce 
to talk openly about D&I;
●
 
Expanding our workforce recognition programs to 
include a prestigious “SPIRIT Award” for D&I
advocates;
●
 
Implementing a “how rating” and an upward feedback 
process as part of our performance
management system to hold our workforce 
and our leaders accountable for D&I;
●
 
Broadening our D&I-related training resources; 
and 
●
 
Advocating for broad participation in, and awareness 
of our extensive network of employee resource
groups, which drew participation from over 5,000 
people in 2020.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
20
We recognize that achieving our D&I goals require the visible actions described above, 
but also requires a
clear linkage to the daily activities of our workforce. 
These activities include:
 
●
 
Educating managers on inclusive hiring practices;
●
 
Conducting immersive D&I training for senior 
leaders and influencers;
●
 
Examining our Talent Management Teams’ processes to eradicate bias within our selection and
succession efforts;
●
 
Working with partners to connect veterans and individuals with disabilities with employment;
●
 
Promoting inclusion of employees with disabilities 
through a robust accommodation process available
to all employees;
●
 
Ensuring diverse internal and external candidate 
slates; and
●
 
Creating balanced interview teams to mitigate 
any unconscious bias in our hiring processes.
 
We actively monitor diversity metrics on a global basis. 
In addition to our internal dashboards, we publicly
report our representation of women and minorities 
in leadership roles. 
We have also committed to publicly
disclose ConocoPhillips’ Consolidated EEO-1 Report 
effective upon our next submission to the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission in 2021.

Our human capital management approach addresses 
programs and processes necessary for ensuring 
an
engaged workforce with the skills to meet 
our business needs. 
We take a holistic view of human capital
management that addresses each of the critical 
components of workforce planning. 
These are described in
more detail below.
 
Hiring & Retention
 
Our success depends on having the right workforce 
to meet our business needs. Attracting and retaining 
a
skilled, 
engaged and diverse workforce is a top priority. 
We conduct routine personnel needs assessments with
leaders to ensure we have the organizational capacity 
and capabilities to execute our business plans. 
We’ve
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21
taken significant steps to embed inclusion into 
each step of our recruiting practices, including 
adapting the way
we construct job descriptions to using intentionally 
diverse interview panels. 
To attract qualified, diverse
candidates for full-time positions or internships, 
we recruit from a number of universities 
in the U.S. 
By
attending conferences and recruiting at Hispanic-serving 
institutions and historically black colleges 
and
universities, we have extended a broader outreach 
to potential diverse candidates.
 
We closely monitor recruitment metrics through our university dashboards in areas 
such as gender, ethnicity
and university acceptance rates to help guide 
decisions and best practices. 
These are disclosed internally
through our D&I Dashboards to ensure greater transparency. 
In addition, voluntary turnover metrics are
routinely tracked and disclosed to guide our 
retention activities, as necessary.

Talent Development
We employ a comprehensive approach for ensuring our workforce is adequately 
prepared for their
responsibilities and also to advance their career. Our workforce is trained 
through a combination of on-the-job
learning, formal training, regular feedback and 
mentoring. 
Skill-based Talent Management Teams (TMTs)
guide employee development and career progression 
by skills and location. The TMTs help identify our future
business needs and assess the availability of 
critical skill sets within the company. We use a performance
management program focused on objectivity, credibility and transparency. 
The program includes broad
stakeholder feedback, real-time recognition and 
a formal rating to assess behaviors to ensure 
they are in line
with our SPIRIT values.
 
ConocoPhillips has established core leadership 
competencies that provide a common baseline 
of knowledge,
skills, abilities, and behaviors to support employee 
performance, growth, and success. 
All supervisors have
access to a voluntary 360-feedback tool to receive 
feedback on their strengths and opportunities 
relative to
these competencies. 
We offer training on a broad range of technical and professional skills, from data
analytics to communication skills.
 
Compensation, Benefits and Well-Being
We offer competitive, performance-based compensation packages and have global equitable 
pay practices. 
Our compensation programs are generally comprised 
of a base pay rate, the annual Variable Cash Incentive
Program (VCIP) and, for eligible employees, the 
Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) program. 
From the CEO to the
frontline worker, every employee participates in VCIP, our annual incentive program, which aligns employee
compensation with ConocoPhillips’ success 
on critical performance metrics and also recognizes individual
performance. 
Our RSU program is designed to attract and 
retain employees, reward performance, and 
align
employee interest with stockholders by encouraging 
stock ownership. 
Our retirement and savings plans are
intended to support employee’s financial futures and are competitive within 
local markets.
 
We routinely benchmark our global compensation and benefits programs to ensure 
they are competitive,
inclusive, aligned with company culture, and allow 
our employees to meet their individual needs and 
the needs
of their families. 
We provide flexible work schedules and competitive time off, including parental leave
policies in many locations. 
In 2020, our U.S. parental leave benefit 
increased from two weeks to six weeks
and combined with our maternity benefit 
(eight weeks), new birth mothers are eligible 
for up to 14 weeks of
paid leave.
 
 
 
 
22
Our global wellness programs include biometric 
screenings and fitness challenges designed 
to educate and
promote a healthy lifestyle. 
All employees have access to our employee assistance 
program, and many of our
locations offer custom programs to support mental 
well-being.
 
Compensation Risk Mitigation
ConocoPhillips has considered the risks associated 
with each of its executive and broad-based compensation
programs and policies. 
As part of the analysis, we considered the performance 
measures we use, as well as the
different types of compensation, varied performance measurement 
periods, and extended vesting schedules
utilized under each incentive compensation program. 
As a result of this review, management concluded the
risks arising from our compensation policies 
and practices are not reasonably likely to have 
a material adverse
effect on ConocoPhillips. 
As part of the Board of Directors’ oversight of ConocoPhillips’ 
risk management
programs, the Human Resources Compensation 
Committee (HRCC) conducts a similar review 
with the
assistance of its independent compensation consultant. 
The HRCC agrees with management’s conclusion that
the risks arising from our compensation policies 
and practices are not reasonably likely to 
have a material
adverse effect on ConocoPhillips.
 
 
GENERAL
 
At the end of 2020, we held a total of 1,038 active 
patents in 50 countries worldwide, including 
419 active
U.S. patents. 
During 2020, we received 65 patents in the U.S. 
and 69 foreign patents. 
Our products and
processes generated licensing revenues of $16 
million related to activity in 2020. 
The overall profitability of
any business segment is not dependent on any 
single patent, trademark, license, franchise 
or concession.
 
Health, Safety and Environment 
Our HSE organization provides tools and support to our 
business units and staff groups to help them ensure
world class HSE performance. 
The framework through which we safely 
manage our operations, the HSE
Management System Standard, emphasizes process 
safety, risk management, emergency preparedness and
environmental performance, with an intense focus 
on process and occupational safety. 
In support of the goal
of zero incidents, HSE milestones and criteria are 
established annually to drive strong safety 
and
environmental performance. 
Progress toward these milestones and criteria 
are measured and reported. 
HSE
audits are conducted on business functions periodically, and improvement actions 
are established and tracked
to completion. 
We have designed processes relating to sustainable development in our economic,
environmental and social performance. 
Our processes, related tools and requirements 
focus on water,
biodiversity and climate change, as well as social 
and stakeholder issues.

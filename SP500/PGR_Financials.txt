General Development of Business
The Progressive Corporation, an insurance holding company, has insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries and affiliates (reference in this Item to subsidiaries includes affiliates as well). Our insurance subsidiaries provide personal and commercial auto insurance, personal residential and commercial property insurance, general liability insurance, and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services. Our non-insurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations. We operate throughout the United States.
Description of Business
Organization
Our executive group oversees the business and corporate groups that support all areas of our organization and consists of the following:
								
Chief Executive Officer
•Chief Financial Officer
		
•Personal Lines President
•Chief Investment Officer
		
•Property General Manager    
•Chief Human Resource Officer
		
•Commercial Lines President
•Chief Information Officer
		
•Claims President
•Chief Legal Officer
		
•Customer Relationship
•Chief Marketing Officer
		              Management President
•Chief Strategy Officer
		
Our insurance and claims organizations are generally managed on a state-by-state basis due to the nature of insurance, legal and regulatory requirements, and other local factors, and are supplemented by national operations and supported by our corporate functions. State-specific organizations typically report to a regional general manager, who then reports to the applicable group president. In California, we operate a separate agency auto organization with its own management.
Personal Lines
Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational vehicles, which we refer to as our special lines products. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted to a specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. As of December 31, 2020, we wrote personal auto insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and we wrote the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states. The Personal Lines business accounted for 82% of our total net premiums written in 2020, and 83% in both 2019 and 2018.
The Personal Lines segment consists of personal auto and special lines products.
•Personal auto insurance represented approximately 94% of our total Personal Lines net premiums written in 2020, 2019, and 2018. We ranked third in market share in the U.S. private passenger auto market for 2019, based on premiums written, and we believe we continued to hold that position for 2020. There are approximately 290 competitors in this market. Progressive and the other leading 16 private passenger auto insurers, each of which writes over $2.5 billion of premiums annually, comprise about 80% of this market. All industry data, including ranking and market share, based on premiums written, has been obtained directly from data reported by either SNL Financial or A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), or was estimated using A.M. Best data as the primary source.
•Special lines products, which include insurance for motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items, represented the remaining Personal Lines net premiums written for the years mentioned above. Due to the seasonal nature of these products, we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry figures are not available, based on our analysis of this market, we believe that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998 and that we are one of the largest providers of specialty RV and boat insurance.

Our Personal Lines products are sold through both the Agency and Direct channels.
•The Agency business includes business written by our network of more than 40,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, including brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines, subject to compliance with our mandated procedures. The agents and brokers do not have authority to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust claims, or enter into other transactions or commitments. The Agency business also writes insurance through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies. The total net premiums written through the Agency channel represented 48% of our Personal Lines volume in 2020, 49% in 2019, and 50% in 2018.
•The Direct business includes business written directly by us on the Internet, through mobile devices, and over the phone. The total net premiums written by the Direct business represented 52% of our Personal Lines volume in 2020, 51% in 2019, and 50% in 2018.
Our Personal Lines strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a broad range of personal auto and special lines insurance products with distinctive service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers, and combined with property insurance and other products when appropriate to match our customers’ needs. Volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness, brand recognition, quality service, and the actions of our competitors, among other factors. See “Competitive Factors” below for further discussion.
We seek to refine our personal auto segmentation, underwriting models, and pricing over time, and we regularly elevate new product models. At any one time, we could have multiple product models in the marketplace as new versions are being rolled out from state to state. Such new product models generally introduce new risk variables intended to improve the accuracy of matching rate to risk, increase our competitiveness, or make our products more attractive to specific market segments, among other enhancements.
We continue to provide customers in both the Agency and Direct channels the opportunity to improve their auto insurance rates
based on their personal driving behavior through Snapshot®, our usage-based insurance program. We offer Snapshot through
our hardware-based version, which is available nationwide except for California, North Carolina, and Virginia due to the regulatory environment, as well as through our mobile-app version, which is available in 44 states and the District of Columbia. This mobile app is intended to improve the user experience while also reducing our monitoring costs. In addition to the personal benefits for our customers, the data collected via the mobile app affords us a unique perspective on mobile device usage, vehicle operations, and accidents. Our updated auto product models, discussed above, often also include Snapshot enhancements to improve its competitiveness and broaden its applicability.
Our Personal Lines business is focused on efforts to form deeper and longer-term relationships with our customers through our Destination Era strategy. Through this strategy, we seek to leverage Progressive Home, our Property business, as well as insurance and non-insurance products offered by unaffiliated third parties, to provide our customers access to a range of products addressing their diverse needs and, if the customer chooses, to “bundle” certain of the products together. Bundled products are an integral part of our consumer offerings and an important part of our strategic agenda. Customers who prefer to bundle represent a sizable segment of the insurance market, and our experience is that they tend to stay with us longer and generally have lower claims costs. Our Destination Era strategy involves a number of initiatives, including:
•In our Agency channel, we offer customers the opportunity to bundle our auto and Progressive Home offerings.
•To further drive bundling in the Agency channel, we offer the Platinum program to those select agents who have the appropriate customers for our bundled offering. This program combines our auto and home insurance with compensation, coordinated policy periods, single event deductible, and other features that meet the needs and desires that our agents have expressed. As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,976 Platinum agents.
•We offer independent agents an agency quoting system that makes it easier for them to bundle multiple policies with us. Our “Portfolio” quoting system reduces data entry, displays all available products eligible for bundled quotes, simplifies the comparative rater experience, and provides agents and their customers an overview of premium, bundle savings, and applied discounts to allow them to add or remove products with one click. Portfolio is available for all agents appointed to write new business in the 46 states and the District of Columbia where we offer Progressive Home products.
•In the Direct channel, we bundle Progressive auto with Progressive Home products in 45 states and the District of Columbia, as well as with homeowners and renters products provided by unaffiliated insurance carriers nationwide. We offer these bundles by providing a single destination to which consumers may come for both their auto and property insurance needs. In many cases, we may offer discounts to incentivize or reward this bundling.

•HomeQuote Explorer® (HQX) is our multi-carrier, direct-to-consumers online property offering. Through HQX, consumers are able to quickly and easily quote and compare homeowners insurance online from Progressive and other carriers. During 2020, we continued to expand the availability of the online buy button via HQX for Progressive Home shoppers, which was active in 23 states at year end, with plans to continue to expand over time.
•As we increase our penetration of the more complex, multi-product customers who are critical to our Destination Era success, we are further expanding the roster of products provided by unaffiliated companies that we make available through online and telephonic referrals and for which we receive commission or other compensation that are reported as service revenues. Our list of unaffiliated company products includes home security, home warranty, personal loans, and health, life, pet, and travel insurance.
•Our special lines products and umbrella insurance can be combined with any of the auto, home, or renters coverages that we offer, in either the Direct or Agency channel.
Commercial Lines
The Commercial Lines segment writes auto-related primary liability and physical damage insurance, and business-related general liability and property insurance, each predominately for small businesses. This business represented 13% of our total net premiums written in both 2020 and 2019, and 12% in 2018. The following discussion excludes transportation network company (TNC) business, unless otherwise noted.
We offer our auto products in 50 states and do not currently write our auto products in the District of Columbia. Our Commercial Lines auto customers insure approximately two vehicles on average. We continue to write about 90% of our Commercial Lines business through the agency channel.
There are approximately 335 competitors in the total U.S. commercial auto market. We primarily compete with about 50 other large companies/groups, each with over $200 million of commercial auto premiums written annually. These leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 80% of this market. Our Commercial Lines business ranked number one in the commercial auto insurance market for 2019 based on premiums written, and we believe that we continued to hold that position for 2020.
The Commercial Lines business operates in the following commercial auto business market targets:
•Business auto – autos, vans, pick-up trucks used by small businesses, such as retailing, farming, services, and private trucking, and for-hire livery (non-fleet (i.e., five or fewer vehicles) taxis, black-car services, and airport taxis),
•For-hire transportation – tractors, trailers, and straight trucks primarily used by regional general freight and expeditor-type businesses and long-haul operators,
•Contractor – vans, pick-up trucks, and dump trucks used by small businesses, such as artisans, heavy construction, and landscapers/snowplowers,
•For-hire specialty – dump trucks, log trucks, and garbage trucks used by dirt, sand and gravel, logging, and coal-type businesses, and
•Tow – tow trucks and wreckers used in towing services and gas/service station businesses.
As with our personal auto products, we regularly introduce new commercial auto product models designed to improve our pricing accuracy and competitiveness through improved segmentation, the use of additional risk variables, and other enhancements. New models are typically rolled out on a state-by-state basis and, as a result, we often have more than one product version in the marketplace at a time.
Similar to Snapshot in the personal auto business, the Commercial Lines business offers its customers usage-based insurance (UBI) options. Smart Haul®, is the UBI program that uses driving data from a motor carriers’ existing electronic logging device. Smart Haul allows owner operators and small fleets to earn discounts for agreeing to share their electronic logging device generated data with us. Snapshot ProView®, which was launched in 2020, is the UBI program for commercial auto customers without their own electronic logging device. Snapshot ProView allows customers to earn upfront discounts and provides value-add services, like fleet management and personalized tips to encourage safe driving. At year-end 2020, both programs were available in 45 states and we plan to expand to more states in 2021.

We offer general liability and property insurance through our business owners policy (BOP) insurance. This product is geared specifically to small businesses and is currently available to agents in 17 states, with plans to expand to additional states during 2021. We also continue to act as an agent for business customers to place BOP, general liability, professional liability, and workers’ compensation coverage through unaffiliated insurance carriers and are compensated through commissions, which are reported as service revenues. To further help our direct customers, we offer BusinessQuote Explorer® (BQX), a digital application that allows small business owners to obtain quotes for our BOP product and the products offered from a select group of unaffiliated carriers.
In addition, we provide commercial auto coverage in the TNC business to Uber Technologies subsidiaries in 13 states and to Lyft’s rideshare operations in 7 states and in the District of Columbia. TNC represented about 4% of our Commercial Lines net premiums written for 2020 and 7% for 2019. Premiums written in our TNC business are determined in part by estimating the number of miles to be driven over the life of the policy term (six or twelve months), on a policy-by-policy basis. These premium estimates are adjusted monthly based both on actual miles driven and an estimate of miles to be driven during the remaining policy term. During 2020, due to social distancing and other restrictions put in place to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, actual miles driven and new mileage forecasts decreased significantly from 2019 levels, resulting in the decrease in net premiums written in our TNC business.
Property
Our Property segment writes residential property insurance in 45 states and the District of Columbia, and renters insurance in 46 states and the District of Columbia, primarily in the independent agency channel and through select agents under our Platinum program to drive home and auto bundling. We also act as a participant in the “Write Your Own” program for the National Flood Insurance Program under which we write flood insurance in 45 states and the District of Columbia; 100% of this business is reinsured.
Our Property business represented about 5% of our total net premiums written in both 2020 and 2018, and 4% in 2019. We tend to see more business written during the second and third quarters of the year based on the cyclical nature of property sales. Losses also tend to be higher during the warmer weather months when storms are more prevalent. As a property insurer, we have exposure to losses from catastrophes, including hurricanes, and other severe storms. To help mitigate these risks, we enter into reinsurance arrangements. See the “Reinsurance” section below for further discussion of our reinsurance programs.
As one of the 15 largest homeowners carriers in the United States, we specialize in property insurance for homes, condos, manufactured homes, and renters, as well as personal umbrella insurance and primary and excess flood insurance. There are approximately 380 competitors in the homeowners insurance market nationwide and we compete with many of these companies. The top 15 carriers, each with over $1 billion of premiums written annually, comprise about 70% of the market.
As discussed above, our Property business is an important component of our Destination Era strategy.
Reinsurance
We cede a portion of our direct premiums written to regulated reinsurance plans. We participate in several mandatory state pools, including the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association, Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, and North Carolina Reinsurance Facility. We also act as servicing agent for state-mandated involuntary plans for commercial vehicles (CAIP plans) and as a participant in the “Write Your Own” program for federally regulated plans for flood (National Flood Insurance Program). All of these programs are governed by insurance regulations.
We also have voluntary contractual arrangements that primarily relate to the Property business and to our TNC and BOP products written by our Commercial Lines business. The reinsurance program in our Property business is designed to reduce overall risk while, to the extent of coverage purchased, protecting capital from the costs associated with catastrophes and severe storms.
For the TNC business we have quota share reinsurance agreements and for our BOP products we have excess of loss reinsurance agreements (with certain BOP coverages having quota share agreements). Under each agreement, we cede a portion of premiums, losses, and loss adjustment expenses. Cession rates for our TNC business vary by state. A portion of the reinsurance is written through reinsurers that are owned by the TNC companies, and these recoverables are collateralized at a target of over 100%. The remaining portion of reinsurance for the TNC business is written by a panel of third-party reinsurers, which are rated “A” or better by A.M. Best.

Our Property business has occurrence excess of loss reinsurance and, new for 2020, an aggregate excess of loss program. The occurrence excess of loss program supports the goal of maintaining adequate capital while sustaining at least two one-in-one hundred year events in a single contract period. It contains several layers: privately-placed reinsurance, a catastrophe bond, and coverage obtained through the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, among other arrangements. The program includes layers that are purchased for multi-year periods, and layers as to which we have prepaid premiums for reinstatement of coverage after the first covered event to ensure coverage for the second event. Under the current program, we are responsible for the first $80 million of losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) from each event. We may be responsible for additional losses if we experience more than two such events or if claims incurred exceed the maximum limits of the reinsurance coverage that is then in place. Coverage limits for a first event in Florida would be $1.95 billion, while coverage for a first event outside of Florida would be $1.55 billion; coverage for a second event (and, potentially, for subsequent covered events) would depend on a number of factors, including the severity and location of the earlier events in the contract period. We expect that in mid-2021 our retention threshold for this program will increase to at least $100 million and that the maximum coverage limits may also be increased, subject to our ongoing negotiations with reinsurers.
Included in the 2020 occurrence excess of loss program is $200 million of reinsurance coverage provided through a catastrophe bond transaction that replaced a similar bond that expired on December 31, 2019. The bond provides reinsurance coverage in the event that a single catastrophe event in Florida exceeds the $1.55 billion in coverage, while coverage for a single catastrophe event outside of Florida would be $1.15 billion, provided by our occurrence catastrophe reinsurance program. Effective June 1, 2021, we have an additional $200 million catastrophe bond that expands our coverage.
In addition, during 2020, we had a property catastrophe aggregate excess of loss program. This agreement contains two layers, each with a retention threshold of $375 million. The first layer provides $130 million of coverage for catastrophe losses and ALAE, except those from named storms (both hurricanes and tropical storms). The second layer provides $70 million for our retained losses and ALAE from both named and non-named storms. The first layer does not have to be exhausted before the second layer can be applied.
On January 1, 2021, we entered into a new aggregate excess of loss program with three layers. The first layer has a retention threshold of $475 million and provides $75 million of coverage for catastrophe losses and ALAE, except those from named storms (both hurricanes and tropical storms). The second layer has a retention threshold of $550 million and provides $50 million of coverage on losses and ALAE from both named and non-named storms. The third layer has a retention threshold of $600 million and provides $100 million of coverage, which includes $95 million under the catastrophe bond, on losses and ALAE from both named and non-named storms to the extent losses are in excess of the coverages provided under the first two layers. Each layer is subject to a per occurrence $2 million deductible before each loss could be considered for aggregate retention, and each event is subject to a $98 million coverage cap. The first layer does not have to be exhausted before the second or third layer can be applied; however, the second layer must be exhausted before the third layer can be applied.
For example, under the 2021 aggregate excess of loss program, if we incurred aggregate non-named catastrophe losses and ALAE (in excess of the $2 million deductible on each loss) of $450 million and named storm losses of $150 million, we would have no reinsurance coverage under the first layer since the non-named catastrophe losses did not exceed the retention threshold; however, we would recognize a reinsurance recoverable of $50 million under the second layer, representing the amount our total losses of $600 million ($450 million of non-named and $150 million of named catastrophe losses) exceeded the $550 million retention threshold.
For accident years 2017 to 2019, we have aggregate stop-loss reinsurance agreements (ASL), with substantially the same terms from year to year. These agreements cover accident year Property losses and certain ALAE except those from named storms (both hurricanes and tropical storms) and liability claims, for business written by ARX subsidiaries that write Property business. As such, these agreements provide protection for losses and ALAE incurred by our Property business in the ordinary course, including those resulting from other significant severe weather events, such as hail, tornadoes, etc. These agreements provide $200 million of coverage to the extent that the net loss and ALAE ratio for the full accident year exceeds 63%. The ASL reduced the likelihood that we would experience a net underwriting loss for reasons other than named storms and liability claims. The ASL agreement for 2019 accident year losses has substantially the same terms as those discussed above for the 2017 and 2018 agreements with the exception that the 2019 ASL also covers an additional $100 million of retained losses and ALAE from named storms.
The reinsurance programs in our Property business are with unaffiliated reinsurance companies, most of which are rated “A” or better by A.M. Best.

Claims
Our employees handle our Personal and Commercial Lines claims from claims offices located throughout the United States, supported by centralized functions at our corporate offices and a nationwide network of just over 2,500 third-party repair shops. For our Property business, we manage a majority of our claims through a network of independent claims field adjusters with internal claims representatives managing the overall claims process. As of December 31, 2020, we employed about 550 internal Property claim representatives and about 140 staff field adjusters; we plan to continue to increase our internal claims staff in 2021.
Competitive Factors
The insurance markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price, agent commission rates, consumer recognition and confidence, coverages offered and other product features, claims handling, financial stability, customer service, and geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized national companies in both the agency and direct channels, and by smaller regional insurers. In the agency channel, some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents. With widely available comparative rating services, consumers can easily compare prices among competitors. Many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanding their online or mobile service offerings. Over the past decade, these changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the property-casualty insurance markets in which we operate.
We rely heavily on technology to operate our business and on extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk. We have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses, and achieving operating efficiencies. High-quality customer service, fair and accurate claims adjusting, and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy. Competition in our insurance markets is also affected by the pace of technological developments. An insurer’s ability to adapt to change, innovate, develop, and implement new applications and other technologies can affect its competitive position. In addition, our competitive position could be adversely impacted if we sustain security breaches or other “cyber attacks” on our systems or are unable to maintain uninterrupted access to our systems, business functions, and the systems of certain third-party providers. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for more information.
In addition, there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which technologies can affect competitive positions in the insurance industry. Some of our competitors have many more patents than we do. Some of the patents we currently hold include a usage-based insurance patent (expiring in 2024 or after), two patents for the system we use for securing e-signature transactions (expiring in 2025 or after), two U.S. patents on the Name Your Price® functionality on our website (expiring in 2028 or after), three multi-product quoting patents (expiring in 2032 or after), two patents for our implementation of a mobile insurance platform and architecture (expiring in 2032 or after), a patent on our system of providing customized insurance quotes based on a user’s price and/or coverage preferences (expiring in 2033 or after), two patents for our loyalty call routing system (expiring in 2033 or after), a patent for a multivariate predictive system that processes usage-based data (expiring in 2035 or after), and three patents for the implementation of chatbots in online quoting and servicing (expiring in 2038 and 2039 or after).
We have a substantial amount of “know-how” developed from years of experience with usage-based insurance, and from analyzing the data from over 35 billion driving miles derived from our usage-based devices and our mobile app. We believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive advantage in the usage-based insurance market. 
State Insurance Licenses
Our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to our subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing.


- 6 -


Insurance Regulation
Our insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. Our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the states of California, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin. In addition, California and Florida treat certain of our subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws. We also have a subsidiary that writes excess and surplus lines; these activities do not require a license but are regulated.
State insurance laws impose numerous requirements, conditions, and limitations on the operations of insurance companies. Insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations. Regulated areas include, among others:
•Licensing of insurers and agents
•Capital and surplus requirements
•Statutory accounting principles specific to insurance companies and the content of required financial and other reports
•Requirements for establishing insurance reserves
•Investments
•Acquisitions of insurers and transactions between insurers and their affiliates
•Limitations on rates of return or profitability
•Rating criteria, rate levels, and rate changes
•Insolvencies of insurance companies
•Assigned risk programs
•Authority to exit a business, and
•Numerous requirements relating to other areas of insurance operations, including: required coverages, policy forms, underwriting standards, and claims handling.
Insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations. In addition, in some states, the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and, from time to time, may investigate certain insurance company practices.
Insurance departments establish and monitor compliance with capital and surplus requirements. Although the ratio of written premiums to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors (including applicable law, the type of business being written, the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves, and the quality of the insurer’s assets), the annual net premiums that an insurer may write historically have been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total surplus, generally 3 to 1 for property and casualty insurance, which is the target for our vehicle businesses; our Property business maintains a lower premiums-to-surplus ratio. Thus, the amount of an insurer’s statutory surplus, in certain cases, may limit its ability to grow its business. At year-end 2020, we had net premiums written of $40.6 billion and statutory surplus of $15.2 billion. The combined premiums-to-surplus ratio for all of our insurance companies was 2.7 to 1. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we had access to $6.2 billion of securities held in a non-insurance subsidiary, portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth or for other purposes. In January 2021, we used the proceeds from the sale of $2.7 billion of these securities to pay our common share dividends.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) also has developed a risk-based capital (RBC) program to enable regulators to identify and take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition. RBC is determined by a series of dynamic surplus-related formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks, such as asset, credit, and underwriting risks. At December 31, 2020, our RBC ratios were in excess of minimum requirements.
Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business. These reports include:
•the insurer’s financial statements under statutory accounting principles,
•details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer,
•specific investments held by the insurer, and


- 7 -


•numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations.
State insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make. Limitations are placed on the amounts an insurer may invest in a particular issuer, as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments. Certain investments are prohibited.
Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of specified information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between insurers and their affiliates. See Note 8 – Statutory Financial Information in our Annual Report for further discussion.
Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the state, to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market. These “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many states also have involuntary market plans, which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.
Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses.
As mentioned above, insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations, including coverages, forms, rating criteria, and rate levels. The ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval.
Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise. Some changes may be due to economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks, while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy, insurance availability, prices, allegations of unfair-discriminatory pricing, underwriting practices, and solvency. In recent years, legislation, regulatory measures, and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, cybersecurity, use of credit and other information in underwriting and rating, insurance rate development, rate of return limitations, and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. The Federal Insurance Office is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk.
Investments
Our investment portfolio, which had a fair value of $47.5 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to $39.3 billion at December 31, 2019, consists of fixed-maturity securities, short-term investments, and equity securities (nonredeemable preferred stocks and common equity securities). Our fixed-maturity securities, short-term investments, and nonredeemable preferred stocks are collectively referred to as fixed-income securities. Our principal investment goals are to manage our portfolio on a total return basis to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write and contribute to our comprehensive income. Our portfolio is invested primarily in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income securities.
Investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio, changes in yield, and other factors. For securities related to our investment portfolios, total investment income includes interest and dividends, net realized gains (losses) on securities sold, and net holding period gains (losses) on securities, which for 2020 and 2019 was composed primarily of valuation changes on equity securities. Total investment income, before expenses and taxes, was $2,566.6 million in 2020, compared to $2,134.5 million in 2019, and $483.3 million in 2018. For our investment portfolio, on a pretax total return basis (i.e., total investment income plus changes in net unrealized gains (losses)), investment income was $3,313.8 million, $2,728.1 million, and $357.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Outside of our investment portfolio, but reported in impairment losses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, were $63.3 million and $68.3 million of other-than-temporary impairment

losses resulting from renewable energy tax credit investments during 2019 and 2018, respectively; no other-than-temporary impairment losses were recognized in 2020. For more detailed discussion of our investment portfolio, see Note 2 – Investments, Note 3 – Fair Value, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Annual Report.
Service Businesses
Our service businesses, which represent less than 1% of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our overall operations, primarily include:
•Commercial Automobile Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP) – We are the only servicing carrier on a nationwide basis for CAIP plans, which are state-supervised plans servicing the involuntary market in 43 states and the District of Columbia. As a service provider, we provide policy issuance and claims adjusting services and collect fee revenue. Reimbursements to us from the CAIP plans are required by state laws and regulations, subject to contractual service standards. Our current CAIP service contract, administered through the Automobile Insurance Plan Services Office, will expire in 2022. We currently do not intend to renew this contract. Any changes in our participation as a CAIP service provider would not materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
•Commission-based businesses – We act as an agent for other insurance companies. We offer home, condominium, and renters insurance, among other products, written by unaffiliated insurance companies in the continental United States in the direct channel. We also offer our customers the ability to package their commercial auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are written by unaffiliated insurance companies. We receive commissions for the policies written under this program, all of which are used to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program.
Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
The consolidated financial statements include the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE), which include ALAE and defense and cost containment expenses, of our insurance subsidiaries. Our objective is to ensure that total reserves (i.e., case reserves and incurred but not recorded reserves, or IBNR) are adequate to cover all loss costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the time reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed. The liabilities for losses and LAE are determined using actuarial and statistical procedures and represent undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid losses and LAE incurred through December 31 of each year. These estimates are subject to the effect of future trends on claims settlement, among other factors.
These estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops and new information becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations and are referred to as “development” of the prior year estimates. In establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policy written. These severities are projected based on historical trends, adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions, claims resolution practices, and general economic trends. These anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary.
See Note 6 – Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves in the Annual Report for a detailed discussion of our loss reserving practices and a reconciliation of our loss and LAE reserve activity, along with incurred and paid claims development by accident year for our segments, based on definitions pursuant to statutory accounting principles.
Human Capital
We believe that our people and our culture are our greatest competitive advantage, and that having the right people working together in the right way is critical to driving our results, building our enduring business, and creating long-term shareholder value. Our culture is deeply rooted in our Core Values (Integrity, Golden Rule, Excellence, Objectives, and Profit) and is the foundation upon which we have designed our strategies to attract, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees. These include talent acquisition, diversity and inclusion, employee engagement, development and retention, competitive pay and benefits, and for 2020, our pandemic response. As of December 31, 2020, we had 43,326 employees.
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)
Diversity and inclusion are fundamental to our success. Our commitment to diversity starts at the top with our highly skilled and diverse Board of Directors. We are one of the few large public companies with both a female CEO and a female independent Board Chairperson. Our D&I efforts are overseen by our Board’s Compensation Committee, and those efforts are implemented at all levels of the organization.

We seek to maintain a fair and inclusive work environment to have our employees reflect the customers we serve and our leaders reflect the people they lead. We publish employee and manager demographic information on our website and update this on an annual basis. We support D&I awareness among our employees through formal training sessions and workshops focused on building our cultural competency and addressing difficult topics such as racial inequality, microinequities, and privilege. We also have nine employee resource groups (African American Network, Asian American Network, Disabilities Awareness Network, Latin American Networking Association, LGBTQ+ Network, Military Network, Network of Empowered Women, Parent Connection and Young Professionals Network) intended to build a community for our employees with common backgrounds, life experiences, and professional challenges. We leverage our extensive contemporary art collection to spark conversations about our culture, innovation, ethical obligations, and respecting our differences.
Employee Acquisition, Retention, Engagement and Development
Our culture and success have enabled us to attract and retain highly talented people from a diverse marketplace. We employ expansive recruiting practices to ensure we have qualified and deep candidate pools and are attracting candidates from both established and new sources. We hired more than 5,500 new employees in 2020, representing about 3.5% of the total applicants for a job at Progressive.
We understand that engaged employees are more productive, provide better service to our customers and are more likely to stay with Progressive. Each year, we survey our people to measure their engagement. We use the results along with other feedback to evaluate our human capital strategies and the health of our culture.
Our formal performance evaluation process is focused on coaching and development, which we believe encourages greater engagement in our business and improved individual performance. Moreover, we actively foster a learning culture and offer several leadership development programs, including our Multicultural Leadership Development Program. Formal training, which covers a broad swath of competencies and skills, is available for both new and tenured employees, and for both individual contributors and leaders.
Promoting from within is a key part of our strategy. Many of our leaders, including current executive team members, joined Progressive in a junior position and advanced to significant leadership positions within the organization. In 2020, we filled approximately 78% of our open jobs above the entry level by promoting our own talent, including just under 900 manager positions.
Our annualized employee retention rate for 2020 was 91% and, as of December 31, 2020, just under 15,000 of our employees had more than 10 years of tenure at the company.
Ethics and Compliance
Our Core Values are the foundation for our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which provides clear expectations for all our people and confirms our commitment to high ethical standards and compliance with legal requirements. We provide ethics training, as well as regular communications, video series, and outside speakers presenting themes such as Courage at our Core and Dare to Disagree, to emphasize our commitment to our ethical and legal responsibilities. Additionally, we have an “open door” policy that empowers every employee to reach out to any manager or any HR representative when they have a question or a concern or they want to share an idea. We also provide a confidential Alertline that is available for employees and others who want to raise a concern anonymously. We encourage our people to speak up, and when they do, we review their concerns, take remedial action where appropriate and do not discriminate or retaliate against them for reporting any concern to us in good faith.
Competitive Pay and Benefits
We seek to provide competitive pay through a combination of fixed and variable compensation. We publish internally the salary range and annual cash incentive target for each of our positions, as well as our assessment of the median pay in the market for comparable jobs. All Progressive people participate in our annual Gainshare bonus program, which measures the growth and profitability of our insurance businesses. We believe Gainshare contributes to the cooperative and collaborative way we work together and, in part, defines our culture. Our executives and other senior leaders also receive compensation in the form of equity awards, which we believe supports a strong pay-for-performance linkage and further aligns their interests with those of our shareholders. We monitor pay equity among employees with similar performance, experience, and job responsibilities, and publish the results annually on our website.
Our employee benefits are intended to be competitive and to support the needs of our people and their families. We invest in the physical, emotional and financial health of Progressive people by providing a broad range of benefits, including: medical, prescription drug, dental, and vison benefits; a 401(k) plan with up to a 6% company match; life insurance; long- and short-term disability insurance; and paid parental leave. We also support flexible work arrangements and paid time off to help our people balance their work and personal lives.

COVID Responses
We took a number of steps during 2020 to support our people during the pandemic. For the health and safety of our employees, we quickly moved as many employees as possible to work from home and implemented additional cleaning and physical distancing protocols at our offices. Recognizing the economic challenges faced by some of our people, we also made advances on Gainshare bonus payments to most of our employees (but not our executives or other senior leaders). We established an employee relief fund to help our people dealing with financial difficulties and provided additional paid time off to employees who needed to care for themselves or family members. We also used various health and wellness communications, events, and activities to address the related anxiety and mental health stress our people may have experienced as a result of the pandemic.

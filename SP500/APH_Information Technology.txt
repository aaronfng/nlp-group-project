Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) Pandemic

​

The COVID-19 pandemic has affected our manufacturing facilities throughout the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers. Throughout most of 2020, particularly during the first half of the year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruptions to our Company, which have included and may continue to include, depending on the specific location, government regulations that limit our ability to operate certain of our facilities at full capacity and to adjust certain costs, travel restrictions, “work-from-home” orders, supplier constraints, supply-chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, and reduced demand from certain customers. During the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021, in several regions around the world, including the United States and Europe, there has been a resurgence in COVID-19 cases. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis, the timing, availability and effectiveness of vaccines, some of which have recently been approved and distributed for use, and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees. Given these uncertainties, we expect the pandemic to continue to have an impact on our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations through at least the first half of 2021 and it could, potentially, extend for the full year and beyond. For a discussion of certain risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the risk factor titled “We face significant risks related to adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein. For a discussion of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Our Strategy

​

The Company’s overall strategy is to provide its customers with comprehensive design capabilities, a broad selection of products and a high level of service on a worldwide basis while maintaining continuing programs of productivity improvement and cost control. Specifically, our business strategy is as follows:

​

 ● Pursue broad diversification - The Company constantly drives to increase the diversity of its markets, customers, applications and products. Due to the tremendous variety of opportunities in the electronics industry, management believes that it is important to ensure participation wherever significant growth opportunities are available. This diversification positions us to proliferate our technologies across the broadest array of opportunities and reduces our exposure to any particular market, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. An overview of the Company’s market and product participation is described under “Markets”. 

​

 ● Develop high technology performance-enhancing interconnect solutions - The Company seeks to expand the scope and number of its preferred supplier relationships. The Company works closely with its customers at the design stage to create and manufacture innovative solutions. These products generally have higher value-added content than other interconnect products and have been developed across the Company’s markets. The Company is focused on technology leadership in the interconnect areas of radio frequency, power, harsh environment, high-speed and fiber optics, as well as sensors, as it views these technology areas to be of particular importance to our global customer base. 

​

 ● Expand global presence - The Company intends to further expand its global manufacturing, engineering, sales and service operations to better serve its existing customer base, penetrate developing markets and establish new customer relationships. As the Company’s global customers expand their international operations to access developing world markets and lower manufacturing costs in certain regions, the Company is continuing to expand its international footprint in order to provide real-time capabilities to these customers. The majority of the Company’s international operations have broad capabilities including new product development. The Company is also able to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs in some regions, and has established low-cost manufacturing and assembly facilities in the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia. 

​

 ● Control costs - The Company recognizes the importance in today’s global marketplace of maintaining a competitive cost structure. Innovation, product quality and performance and comprehensive customer service are not mutually exclusive with controlling costs. Controlling costs is part of a mindset. It is having the discipline to invest in programs that have a good return, maintaining a cost structure as flexible as possible to respond to changes in the marketplace, dealing with suppliers and vendors in a fair but prudent way to ensure a  
4
Table of Contents
  reasonable cost for materials and services and creating a mindset where managers manage the Company’s assets as if they were their own. 

​

 ● Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments - The Company believes that the industry in which it operates is highly fragmented and continues to provide significant opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Accordingly, we continue to pursue acquisitions of high potential companies with strong management teams that complement our existing business while further expanding our product lines, technological capabilities and geographic presence. Furthermore, we seek to enhance the performance of acquired companies by leveraging Amphenol’s position with customers across our diverse end markets, our leading technologies and our access to low-cost manufacturing around the world. In 2020, the Company invested approximately $50 million to fund two acquisitions and announced a definitive agreement to acquire MTS for $1.7 billion, while in 2019, the Company invested approximately $937 million to fund nine acquisitions. Our acquisitions in 2020 and 2019 have strengthened our customer base and product offerings in many of our end markets.  

​

 ● Foster collaborative, entrepreneurial management - Amphenol’s management system is designed to provide clear income statement and balance sheet responsibility in a flat organizational structure. Each general manager is incented to grow and develop his or her business and to think entrepreneurially in providing innovative, timely and cost-effective solutions to customer needs. In addition, Amphenol’s general managers have access to the resources of the larger organization and are encouraged to work collaboratively with their peers throughout the Company to meet the needs of the expanding marketplace and to achieve common goals.

​

Backlog and Seasonality

​

The Company estimates that its backlog of unfilled firm orders as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $2.380 billion compared with backlog of approximately $1.978 billion as of December 31, 2019. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Unfilled orders may generally be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could result in temporary changes to the seasonality of our business. For a discussion of certain risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to the risk factor titled “We face significant risks related to adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic” in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors herein.

​

Human Capital Management and Our Culture

​

The Company’s success is based on the capability, adaptability and accountability of our people around the world.  One of the key components of our business strategy is the fostering of a collaborative and entrepreneurial management culture. Each of our general managers operates in a flat organizational structure and is incented to grow and develop their business, with the support of the resources of the larger organization. We believe this structure, with approximately 120 general managers running unique businesses, creates an environment and culture where each of our employees has a more direct link to the success of their individual businesses and a more personal connection to the employees they oversee and the communities in which they operate.

​

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 80,000 employees worldwide, with the majority of our people based in the Asia-Pacific region.  The Company believes that it has a good relationship with both its unionized and non-unionized employees. 

​

Governance and Culture - Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is actively involved in overseeing the Company’s employee-related strategies and practices as well as the Company’s culture. This oversight is conducted both directly and through certain of the Board’s committees.  At each of its regularly scheduled quarterly meetings, the Board reviews changes in key personnel and, at least annually, meets with management to discuss various human resources related topics, including talent development, succession planning, compensation and culture. We believe the Company’s culture has been a critical component of the Company’s success and reinforcing that culture is a key responsibility of our executive management.

​

Diversity and Inclusion - Our business spans the globe and the employees in our facilities reflect the diversity of our geographic footprint.  The Company generally relies on local general management in every region, which we believe creates a strong degree of organizational stability and a deep commitment to our people and the local community.  At Amphenol, we aim to create an inclusive working environment where all employees are respected and treated equally. This message is emphasized from the top of our organization down to each of our employees. A key hallmark of our structure is our entrepreneurial culture that creates clear accountability for each of our general managers, who are our key business leaders. Our core management team is comprised of these general managers, as well as their controllers and our 
10
Table of Contents
executive team.  Women represented 29% of this core management group at the end of 2020. Of our total employees worldwide, we are proud that approximately half are women.

​

Health, Safety and Well-being - The safety and well-being of our employees is critical to our successful operation. Our health and safety activities are overseen by our corporate environmental, health, safety and sustainability leadership team but are managed by our local teams, who coordinate on-site safety programs, resources, reporting and training in our facilities. We believe that this model of coaching and tracking at the corporate level, but administering at the facility level, has allowed us to provide training and supervision that better fits the local needs of each of our workforces. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken additional actions to protect the physical and mental health and well-being of our employees throughout the world, including in particular those employees who work in our factories. We have also encouraged employees to work from home when possible and appropriate and have taken an integrated approach to helping our employees optimally manage their work and personal responsibilities.

​

Community and Social Impact - Amphenol recognizes that we have a responsibility to be a positive influence in the communities in which we operate around the world. Most of our community outreach is organized by our local management teams, which helps ensure that our efforts are working in support of the local communities in which our employees live and work. Our local teams are actively supporting their communities in a variety of ways including: school supply drives, local blood drives, mentoring of at-risk students, community clean-up events, local tree planting, holiday-giving events and food delivery services to immobile individuals.

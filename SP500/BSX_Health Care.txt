We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and then necessary training and tools for our operations team. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities.

We remain committed to maintaining appropriate investments in supply chain resiliency on an ongoing basis. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. Supply chain resiliency also includes sterilization, which is performed and optimized through a combination of internal and third party locations and may also be subject to potential interruptions. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We have an ongoing supplier resiliency program which identifies and mitigates risk. We are also striving to build diversity and inclusion into every aspect of our company, including our supply chain. We are committed to the increased and sustained support of diverse businesses that share our dedication to improving the quality of patient care.

Quality Assurance

We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. Our quality system is also designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations, including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our medical device manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for medical devices, which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor, and maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.

Environmental Regulation and Management

We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions, some from companies that may have greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. In certain countries, we face competition from domestic medical device companies that may benefit from their status as local suppliers. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products, or from companies offering technologies that could augment or replace procedures using our products.

We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers by enabling physicians to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively often in a less-invasive manner. We also compete on ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increasing prevalence and importance of regional and national tenders, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have
11

been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to:

•offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes,
•create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies,
•apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets,
•develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions,
•attract and retain skilled personnel,
•obtain patent or other protection for our products,
•obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals,
•compete in regional and national tenders for our products,
•continually enhance our quality systems,
•manufacture and market our products and solutions either directly or through third parties, and
•supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.

Medical Device Regulatory Approvals

The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device.

In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the “predicate” device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.

The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA may seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.

The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). A HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE must demonstrate that the device does not expose the patient to unreasonable risk and that the benefit of device use outweighs the risk. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.

In the European Union (EU), we will be required to comply with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR or EU MDR) effective May 2021 (previously May 2020) which will supersede the current Medical Device Directives. Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the current Directives (issued before May 2021) can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE Certificate expires, whichever comes first, providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use. The CE Mark, which is required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following a Conformity Assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification by the manufacturer. The selected pathway to CE marking is based on device risk classification. CE marking indicates conformity to the applicable Essential Requirements (ERs) of the relevant Medical Devices Directive and, in the future, to the General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) for the MDR. The MDR will change multiple aspects of the existing regulatory framework for CE marking, such as increased clinical evidence requirements, changes to labelling, and new requirements, including Unique Device Identification (UDI), and
12

many new post-market reporting obligations. MDR modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the medical device industry and will require significant investment over the next few years to implement.

We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market, such as the requirements that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), through the review at Japanese Pharmaceutical & Medical Device Agency (PMDA) and the China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA). Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, or had minimal regulations, are now introducing them. For example, India is in the process of expanding its current regulations to include all medical device categories while many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia are introducing new regulations as well.

The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order recall or market withdrawal of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.

International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China, for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.

Government Affairs

We maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies that may potentially impact the Company, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state Governors, legislatures and regulatory agencies, embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers to improve patient care and to advance our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general. The Government Affairs office also advocates for public policy that benefits our employees, and the patients we serve and supports the communities in which we live.

Healthcare Policies and Reimbursement

Political, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders are significant and new therapies may now take longer periods of time to gain widespread adoption.

The U.S. Federal government and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency, or "sunshine," in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals (HCPs). As a
13

result, we are required by law to report many types of payments and transfers of value provided to HCPs. Certain foreign jurisdictions have similar laws or are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to comply with sunshine laws and/or implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Additional legislation at the state and federal levels may result in further changes to these laws.

We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as price transparency, expansion of site neutrality, or consistent reimbursement regardless of treatment location, alternative payment reform, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs), continue to take shape in the U.S. and abroad. We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., China, Australia, and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.

Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the services provided to their patients. Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures. The new U.S. Administration may attempt to reverse some of the previous Administration’s changes to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), particularly related to healthcare coverage for the uninsured, and is further expected to introduce more ambitious healthcare legislation, which could include what is commonly referred to as a “public option” or changes to Medicare age requirements. If passed, this legislation would lead to increased coverage levels and utilization of services; however, at this point, the impact of any such changes is unclear because specific changes have not been enacted or implemented.

Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2020, we held more than 18,000 patents and had approximately 6,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.

We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties.

We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2020 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved.

Human Capital

At Boston Scientific, our work is guided by core values that define our culture and empower our employees, including Caring, Diversity, Global Collaboration, High Performance, Meaningful Innovation and Winning Spirit. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 38,000 employees, including approximately 16,000 in operations, 18,000 in selling, marketing, distribution and administration, and 4,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development. Of these employees, we employed approximately 21,000 outside the U.S., approximately 10,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function. We believe the collective talent of our employees and our shared corporate culture and values give us a competitive advantage.
In our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate. Hiring, developing and retaining talented employees are key parts of our strategy and are critical to our success. We strive to do this by fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace, providing competitive pay and benefits, offering ongoing employee growth and development opportunities and cultivating a culture that prioritizes employee health, safety and wellness.

Diversity Equity and Inclusion

We do our best work to advance health care when we have a diverse range of perspectives and experience on our team. Innovation thrives in a culture of engagement and inclusion. The society in which we live and the customers and patients we serve are diverse and our employees must reflect this. In recent years, we have made steady progress to increase the overall representation of employees who identify as women and as African American/Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races (together, multicultural talent). As of December 31, 2020, women represented 30 percent of our Board of Directors, and 47 percent of our employees. In addition, 34 percent of employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico identified as multicultural.

We are committed to our goal of making further progress toward expanding our workforce diversity. We have set measurable Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) goals with our “3UP by 2023” initiative, including a three percent increase in representation of both women and multicultural talent at the supervisor and manager level to 43 percent and 23 percent, respectively by December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, 40 percent of employees in management roles are women and 21 percent are multicultural. We were proud to be a globally recognized leader for workplace inclusion, named a Top 10% Inclusion Index Company by Diversity Best Practices in 2020. Our Executive Committee and our Board of Directors have oversight over employee diversity metrics and hiring trends. As evidence of our commitment to expand diversity, equity and inclusion, we have introduced a human capital performance metric to our 2021 Annual Bonus Plan. Our Executive Committee will be measured against global gender and U.S. (inclusive of Puerto Rico) multicultural goals, leadership bench retention goals and performance against annual renewable energy and recycling index goals.

In addition, our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are at the heart of our DE&I strategy. ERGs are voluntary, company-sponsored employee groups that foster and celebrate our diverse work environment. They provide forums for us to learn from one another, celebrate our differences and develop inclusive leadership skills. We support each ERG by designating global and local executive sponsors and providing financial resources. Our ERG chapters around the world collaborate across the business at all levels and are powerful voices for change in the company.

Compensation and Benefits

Competitive compensation and benefits programs are essential for a productive and thriving workforce. As part of our broader rewards portfolio, we offer competitive pay and benefits that are flexible and affordable in order to meet the individual needs of our employees. Our benefits include cash bonus programs, incentive stock awards, health insurance, paid time off and family leave, retirement savings plans, childcare and Employee Assistance Programs that encourage overall well-being, including help with finances, family planning and support, elder/childcare and mental health.

Our global compensation practices are rooted in our values and the high priority we place on paying people equally for equal work. We regularly benchmark salaries, conduct annual internal and external parity audits and review pay recommendations company wide. In addition, we periodically contract with an independent, third party to assess pay equity across all positions. Our most recent analysis showed that our global workforce had a less than one percent statistical difference in pay along gender lines. Similarly, a less than one percent statistical difference in pay was noted for multicultural talent in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

15

Employee Health and Safety

We take a global approach to prioritizing and monitoring employee safety and we strive to foster a safety-oriented culture in all of our offices and facilities. We set health and safety goals which measure the number of injuries per 100 employees for every manufacturing and distribution site. Our Employee Health & Safety Operations Council reviews performance monthly to discuss trends and risks, as well as opportunities for improvement. We have established a company-wide safety goal of 0.25 or fewer injuries per 100 employees by 2030, cutting our 2019 incident rate by 50 percent.

Employee Growth and Development

Developing our people professionally is one of the most important things we do. We have a robust succession planning program to ensure our future leaders are ready to assume roles as they become available. At every level of the company, employees have access to training and tools they can use to advance their skills and expertise and create greater possibilities for their careers. We offer professional and technical courses, including on-the-job training, skills-based learning, mentoring opportunities and leadership development programs for high-potential employees.

Employee Engagement

We seek ongoing feedback from our employees to better understand what we are doing well and, conversely, how we can improve their experience. In addition to encouraging ongoing communication and feedback between employees and their managers, we conduct periodic employee engagement surveys to ensure all employees have an opportunity to share their insights and we take appropriate action in response.

Corporate Social Responsibility

Within many of the communities in which we operate, we have launched and funded a multi-year program to combat racism, inequity and injustice focused on five pillars: community, economic empowerment, education, healthcare disparities and government/legislative change. We also continue our long-term Close the Gap initiative, which focuses on raising awareness and empowering healthcare providers to reach more patients of color, fight longstanding inequities, and address barriers to care. Through Close the Gap, hospitals and health systems are provided with zip code level data that highlight the disparities in treatment between white and non-white patients in their communities. The information allows health care administrators and providers to focus on improving care to underserved populations within their communities.

As evidence of our progress, we were named among the Top 50 of America’s Most Just Companies by Forbes/Just Capital, ranking #38 overall and also tied #1 for diversity, equity and inclusion. We were also named to the 2020 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America, one of the most prestigious global benchmarks for corporate responsibility, as well as Newsweek's America's Most Responsible Company 2021 list. We are also listed on the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. These listings and awards recognize our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies. These honors are a testament to our company-wide focus on corporate social responsibility.

Sustainability

A critical priority for us as a global medical device manufacturer is to deliver on our promise to customers and patients while caring for the planet. The way we do our jobs each day contributes to reducing our environmental impacts, achieving carbon neutrality and improving supply chain sustainability. We are making measurable progress toward shaping a better future for our planet by proactively addressing energy consumption, carbon emissions, waste management and water use. We have committed to a goal of carbon neutrality in our manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030. Our Environment, Health & Safety (EH&S) Center of Excellence is responsible for rigorously measuring, assessing and reporting progress toward these goals globally. We are focused on a “C3” strategy: Cutting energy use, Converting to renewable energy sources and Compensating with carbon offset projects where needed. Certain of our manufacturing sites use high-efficiency technologies such as combined heat and power to generate energy that is cleaner than conventional gas, oil or coal-fired power and our Corporate Headquarters and U.S. distribution center both utilize solar energy. We are on target to source or generate 100 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2024. By 2027, we expect that 90 percent of all energy used across our facilities, including electricity and natural gas, will be renewable representing an important milestone toward our 2030 carbon neutrality commitment.

16

We have obtained ISO 50001:2018 - Energy Management Systems certification for our three manufacturing plants in Ireland and our Tier I Distribution Center in Kerkrade, the Netherlands. We have also obtained ISO 14001:2015 - Environment Management Systems certification at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world, as well as our Corporate headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. ISO 50001:2018 and ISO 14001:2015 are globally recognized standards for Environmental and Energy Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provide a voluntary framework to identify key environmental and energy aspects associated with our business. Using these management systems and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint. We also have 15 LEED-certified buildings on campuses in the U.S., Central America, Europe and Asia. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is an internationally recognized certification program for the environmental performance and sustainable design of buildings.

Community Outreach

We are united by a goal to make a difference in the lives of the approximately 30 million patients we serve annually. We seek to give our time and resources to make positive impacts upon those communities where we live, work, and serve. Guided by our core values, we seek to improve access to healthcare, to invest in educational programming for students with limited means and access to opportunities, and to support and embrace the spirit of volunteerism within our global workforce, while adhering to strong ethical standards.

In some parts of the world, access to health information, screening, care and services can be limited. Our collaborations with non-profit community organizations raise awareness of chronic disease and decrease these health disparities by improving health outcomes for underserved populations. We accomplish this through our focus on 3 P’s - Prevent, Provide and Prepare. We work to prevent chronic disease through education and awareness, provide access to healthcare through increasing the quantity and quality of healthcare workers and screenings, and preparing and empowering children at high risk of or who already have a chronic disease to successfully navigate their health journey. Since 2018, we have partnered with Children’s HeartLink, a US-based global health organization, with a mission of saving the lives of children with heart disease.

We are also passionate about inspiring young learners to see themselves in a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) role in the future. Our employees work with underrepresented K-12 students around the world and share their passion for STEM by providing interactive product demos, development programs, and hands-on activities for young learners in their communities. Through our outreach efforts, we are helping to develop the diverse future talent that will enable Boston Scientific to create innovative health solutions for generations to come.

Beyond the classroom, we empower our employees to participate in and influence the way we care for people in their local communities. Through a number of global activities, employees helped pack over 34,000 kits from their homes that provided STEM activities, health and wellness supplies, snacks and other essentials to populations in need. We are proud of these efforts and the collective impact we have on advancing possibilities across the globe. In 2020 our employees volunteered to make a positive impact in community activities in more than 50 countries.

We also support the U.S. communities where we have significant business presences through the Boston Scientific Foundation. The mission of the Foundation is simple: to help expand access to quality healthcare and educational opportunities for underserved populations. The Boston Scientific Foundation awarded scholarships to children of employees and grant awards across the U.S. in 2020. The process involved more than 65 employee volunteers who evaluated proposals for the Boston Scientific Foundation Board review and approval, upon which the Boston Scientific Foundation was able to help fuel grassroots innovative solutions to improve access to quality healthcare and create new opportunities for students to learn and achieve.

In 2020, we found new and creative ways to help our communities navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. We contributed more than $18 million to aid relief efforts globally through monetary and supply donations and by providing engineering and manufacturing expertise and resources. This included donations of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical equipment to local hospitals and government agencies. Through collaboration with the University of Minnesota Bakken Medical Device Center and industry peers, we brought an emergency resuscitator to market, which can be used as an alternative when traditional ventilators are not available. We also provided support to children, families and the most vulnerable through direct financial contributions to local community and global non-profit organizations, including Project HOPE and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Seasonality

Our net sales are influenced by many factors, including product launches, acquisitions, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, patient, physician and employee holiday schedules and other macro-economic conditions. While our consolidated net sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality, customer purchases of our medical devices have historically been lower in the first and third quarters of the year.

Stewardship: Health, Safety and Environmental
At Celanese, rather than just focus on occupational safety of our employees, contractors and any visitors to our sites, we have an expanded view and measurement of "Stewardship" that includes process safety and environmental releases since they may have an impact on the community. Our stewardship values are critical to our success in attracting and retaining the best industry talent across the globe.
As a company, we strive to do no harm to people, the environment or the communities that host our facilities. We believe in continuous improvement by building competency in our people and having a comprehensive management system built from recognized practices from around the globe. Our values include a commitment to the health and safety of our employees, contractors, communities and environment.

The Company utilizes a mixture of leading and lagging indicators to assess the health and safety performance of our operations. Lagging indicators for occupational safety include the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") and the Lost Time Incident Rate ("LTIR") based upon the number of incidents per 200,000 work hours of both employees and contractors. Process Safety indicators follow the industry standard from API RP 754 for Tier 1 and 2 events for incident count, rate, and severity. The criteria for environmental indicators is 10% or greater of the Celanese reportable quantity (based on EPA methodology or internal default release values). Leading indicators include reporting and resolution of all near miss events, behavioral safety observations, hazard recognitions resolved and all releases that fall below the previously-mentioned threshold. Leading process safety indicators include challenges to safety systems. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had a TRIR of 0.21, a LTIR of 0.07 and two work-related fatalities. We also had eight Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety incidents and nine environmental releases. Through deliberate actions, we have improved our employee safety, process safety and environmental incident metrics in recent years.
Health and Wellness
Our efforts to support our employees' physical well-being starts with comprehensive health benefits offered to all US employees who work more than 20 hours per week, plus their eligible family members. Around the world, we offer other benefits that are competitive in each of the countries where we operate.
The cornerstone programs in the US are:
•Medical coverage with above-industry-average employer contributions to a Health Savings Account, including benefits for transgender employees and dependents and access to a low-cost and convenient telemedicine service;
•Dental and vision coverage that offers employees choices and free or low-cost preventive care; and
•Wellness programs that promote annual physicals for all employees and niche programs such as smoking cessation.
To further create a positive impact in the lives of employees and their families, the following services are available at no cost to our eligible participants:
•Access to an expert medical second opinion with a board-certified doctor when dealing with an illness, injury or chronic pain;
•Participation in a virtual physical therapy program to help with chronic musculoskeletal pain;
•A program created to empower all people with diabetes to live better, healthier lives; and
•In 2020, we expanded our mental health offerings to provide more services to more employees around the world.
Talent Development
At Celanese, we are committed to fostering an engaging and inclusive workplace with opportunities for collaboration, development and leadership. Our Talent Management strategies provide a consistent and efficient approach to how we acquire talent, manage performance, develop bench strength, support development and help employees reach their fullest potential.
We have a structured approach to reviewing talent with management as well as with the Board of Directors. This includes discussions of employee development, executive succession, diversity, talent pipelines and workforce planning requirements. We regularly report to the Board of Directors on talent development and succession across each functional area, and an annual review of executive succession with the Board of Directors.
We believe in giving employees clear opportunities to pursue their unique career goals and helping our leaders be a resource, champion and coach. Our Global Career Framework provides clarity around opportunities that can exist at Celanese and it also removes artificial barriers to help employees own their own careers. It allows employees to regularly increase their scope and responsibility, both within an employee's current role and moving to new roles. We also provide a specific technical career ladder for employees in technical roles to enable employees in manufacturing and other technical functions to grow their careers. We also utilize our Leadership Framework to define the attributes, competencies and behaviors of leaders at Celanese. We provide online courses, leadership webinars and other resources to support employee development.

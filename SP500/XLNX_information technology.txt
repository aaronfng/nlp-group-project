Industry Overview

Several silicon architectures including microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), application specific standard products (ASSPs), and custom application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are used for compute in most digital electronic systems today. Central processing units (CPUs) historically have been the most common platform used by software developers but have limitations when used for modern compute tasks ranging from real-time control to machine learning. Fixed function acceleration and heterogeneous systems ranging from GPUs, ASSPs, and custom ASICs meet some of these compute demands but with a limited range of flexibility.

Xilinx develops adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies - from the endpoint to the edge to the cloud. Xilinx is the inventor of the FPGA, hardware programmable SoCs and the ACAP, all designed to deliver the most dynamic processor technology for adaptable systems. In particular, the ACAP draws on the strengths of CPUs, FPGAs, and fixed function accelerators to accelerate any workload with ease-of-use for software and hardware developers alike.

Other advantages of Xilinx adaptable platforms include:

•
Faster time-to-market and increased design flexibility.  Both advantages are enabled by Xilinx development tools which allow users to implement and revise their designs quickly. In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require significant development time and offer limited, if any, flexibility to make design changes.  
 
•
Xilinx adaptable platforms are standard components. This means that the same device can be sold to many different users for a myriad of applications. In sharp contrast, ASICs and ASSPs are customized for an individual user or a specific application.

Hardware adaptable platforms are generally disadvantaged in terms of relative device size when compared to devices that are designed to perform a fixed function in a single or small set of applications. ASICs and ASSPs tend to be smaller than FPGAs, hardware programmable SoCs, and ACAPs performing the same fixed function, resulting in a lower unit cost. 

However, there is a high fixed cost associated with ASIC and ASSP development that is not applicable to customers of hardware programmable ICs. This fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development significantly increases for every next generation technology node.  From a total cost of development perspective, ASICs and ASSPs have generally been more cost effective when used in high-volume production, and hardware programmable platforms have generally been more cost effective when used in low- to mid-volume production.  However, we expect hardware adaptable platforms to be able to address higher volume applications and gain market share from ASIC and ASSP suppliers as the fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development increases on next generation technology nodes.

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy for growth is to displace ASICs, ASSPs and traditional PLDs in next generation electronic systems. Additionally, we focus on enabling “building the adaptable intelligent world" with an emphasis on the three major elements described below.

•
Data center first: Xilinx is ramping up its efforts with key data center customers, ecosystem partners and software application developers, to further enable innovation and deployments in compute acceleration, computational storage and network acceleration.
•
Accelerated growth in core markets: core markets consist of automotive; wireless infrastructure; wired communications; audio, video and broadcast; aerospace and defense; industrial, scientific and medical; test, measurement and emulation; and consumer technologies where the Company has leadership technology and substantial market traction. These core markets and customers are central to Xilinx, and Xilinx continues to drive and enable innovation in these areas.
•
Drive adaptive computing with the introduction of ACAP: in March 2018, we announced ACAP, which we believe is a breakthrough product category. ACAP is a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform that can be programmed at the hardware level to adapt to the needs of a wide range of applications and workloads. An ACAP's adaptability, which can be done dynamically in milliseconds during operation, delivers levels of performance and performance per-watt that is unmatched by CPUs or GPUs. 

The costs and risks associated with application-specific devices can only be justified for high-volume or highly-specialized commodity products. Programmable platforms, alternatively, are becoming critical for our customers to meet increasingly stringent product requirements – cost, power, performance and density – in a business environment characterized by increased complexity, shrinking market windows, rapidly changing market demands, capped engineering budgets, escalating ASIC and ASSP engineering costs and increased economic and development risk.

Table of Contents

With every new generation of our products, our strategy is to increase the performance, density and system-level functionality and integration, while driving down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node. This enables us to provide simpler, smarter programmable platforms and design methodologies allowing our customers to focus on innovation and differentiation of their products. Our strategy includes expanding our user base by making our platforms more accessible to users who don’t have prior experience with hardware programmable devices.

Our products now compete in several areas of the semiconductor industry that are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion.  We expect continued competition from our primary PLD competitors such as Intel Corporation (Intel), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi, acquired by Microchip), and from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation (Broadcom), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (Marvell) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (Texas Instruments), as well as from companies such as NVIDIA with whom we historically have not competed. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. Other competitors include manufacturers of:

•
high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;
•
high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;
•
ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic;
•
high-speed, low-density complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs);
•
high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices;
•
products with embedded processors;
•
products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers;
•
discrete general-purpose GPUs targeting data center and automotive applications; and
•
other new or emerging programmable logic products.

We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include:

•
product pricing;
•
time-to-market;
•
product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;
•
field upgradability;
•
adaptability of products to specific applications;
•
ease of use and functionality of software design tools;
•
availability and functionality of predefined IP;
•
completeness of applicable software solutions;
•
adherence to industry-standard programming environments;
•
inventory and supply chain management;
•
access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity;
•
ability to provide timely customer service and support; and
•
access to advanced packaging technology.

We are also actively contributing to numerous industry open source software initiatives across a broad range of technologies.
 
As a result of our R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past several years including the Virtex and Kintex UltraScale and UltraScale+, Zynq UltraScale+MPSoC, Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoCs, Alveo board and Versal ACAP families. We have enhanced our IP core offerings and software design suite (Vivado) as well as introduced our unified software platform (Vitis). Through process technology collaboration with our foundry suppliers along with strategic investment in Electronic Design Automation tools and improved design techniques, we were the first PLD company to ship 45nm, 28nm, 20nm and 16nm FPGA devices in high volume. Additionally, our investment in R&D has allowed us to ship the industry's first 28nm and 16nm and 7nm devices with embedded ARM technology, the industry's first All Programmable SoC with integrated RF Data Converters, as well as the industry's first 3D Stacked Silicon Interconnect Technology IC devices on the 28nm, 20nm and 16nm process nodes.

The COVID-19 pandemic did not have any significant impact on our R&D activities and efforts in fiscal 2020. Although almost all of our employees have been working remotely since March 16, 2020, we have long had a business continuity plan and invested in technologies and tools that would support our employees in effectively working remotely. We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success, and we will continue to invest in our technology.

Sales and Distribution

We sell our products to OEMs, EMS and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs and EMS. We are also developing a network of Value Added Resellers (VARs) and Integrated Solution Vendors (ISVs) for our Alveo products. We characterize distributors, VARs and ISVs as our distribution channel.


11
Table of Contents

We use a dedicated global sales and marketing organization, and to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives, to generate sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on key accounts. Our distribution channel and independent sales representatives create demand within the balance of our customer base in defined territories or for markets aligned with their focus. The distributor channel also provides inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of OEM or end customers.

As discussed under the caption "We are subject to regulatory and operational risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could adversely affect our business." in Item 1A "Risk Factors," how, where and to whom we sell our products is affected by an evolving regulatory environment, among other factors. Even when specific regulatory changes – such as the April 2020 announcement by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce of the elimination of the license exception CIV (civil end-users), which had permitted certain national security-controlled items to be exported to certain destinations, such as China, without a license, and the expansion of controls over items for military end-uses in China, Russia and Venezuela – are not ultimately expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results, they nonetheless require substantial management and operational resources in order to maintain compliance.

Whether Xilinx, the distributor, or the independent sales representative identifies the sales opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear most legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, including such risks as credit loss, inventory shrinkage, theft and foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding certain indemnity and warranty liabilities.

In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted our authorized distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a change in list prices subsequent to the initial sale. Revenues from sales to our distributors and non-distributors are recognized upon the transfer of control, which typically occurs at shipment.

Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes our products worldwide. Avnet's revenue accounted for 42%, 45% and 43% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, Avnet accounted for 31% and 37%, respectively, of our total net accounts receivable. We expect our accounts receivable to fluctuate as we partner with our distributors to manage their inventory requirements. We also use other regional distributors throughout the world. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since PLDs are standard products, they do not carry many of the inventory risks posed by ASICs. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition. See "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for information about concentrations of credit risk and "Note 15. Segment Information" for information about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations.

No other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.

As most of our employees, and those of our customers, are currently working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience some delays in processing orders and deliveries in fiscal 2021 for the duration of the pandemic.

Backlog

As of March 28, 2020, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $503.0 million, compared to $644.0 million as of March 30, 2019. Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty. As a result, backlog from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period.

Wafer Fabrication

As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs. Rather, we purchase our wafers from independent foundries including TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung). TSMC manufactures the wafers for our Advanced Products.

Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations with each wafer foundry.

Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs, board products and supporting software ecosystem rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of wafers manufactured with leading-edge process technologies, and we adjust loadings at particular foundries to meet our business needs.

While we did not experience any manufacturing or supply disruption in fiscal 2020, wafer deliveries may be delayed in the future if the pandemic is not contained and our employees continue to work remotely.
  
Sort, Assembly and Test

Wafers are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors. Sorted die are assembled by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units are generally tested by independent test subcontractors or by Xilinx personnel. We purchase most of our assembly services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. and most of our test services from King Yuan Electronics Company in Taiwan.

Generally, the COVID-19 pandemic and related business closures have not disrupted our sorting, testing and packaging activities to date. However, if the pandemic is not contained and its social, economic and business impact broadens, we may experience delay in deliveries by business partners and, as a result, a material adverse impact on our operations and financial conditions.

Quality Certification

Xilinx has achieved and currently maintains quality management system certification to ISO9001 for our facilities in San Jose, California; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore; and Hyderabad, India. In addition, Xilinx achieved and currently maintains ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 environmental health and safety management system certifications in the San Jose and Singapore locations.

Intellectual Property and Licenses

While our various proprietary intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks) are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. As of March 28, 2020, we held over 4,800 issued patents, which vary in duration, and over 1,300 pending patent applications relating to our proprietary technology in various jurisdictions around the world. We maintain an active program of filing for additional patents in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, applications, system and platform architecture, IP cores, testing methodologies, semiconductor manufacturing and other technologies relating to our products and business. We licensed portions of our patent portfolio to certain external parties and obtained patent licenses from certain third-parties as well.

We have acquired various licenses from third parties to certain technologies that are implemented in IP cores or embedded in our devices, such as processors. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired various licenses to certain third-party proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools.  Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which customers depend.

Xilinx, the Xilinx logo, Alveo, Artix, CoolRunner, ISE, Kintex, Spartan, Versal, Vitis, Virtex, Vivado, Zynq are trademarks of Xilinx in the United States and/or other countries. Maintaining these trademarks, and the goodwill associated with them, is important to our business. We have also obtained the rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and other trademark owners that are related to our products and business.

We intend to continue to protect our intellectual property vigorously. We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property rights or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We incurred, and in the future we may continue to incur, litigation expenses to defend against claims of infringement and to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be successful.

Corporate Responsibility

Xilinx places a high level of importance on corporate responsibility. Through senior-level sponsorship, regular environmental, health and safety assessments and company-wide performance targets, we strive to achieve a culture that emphasizes contribution to local and global communities through a number of key initiatives:

We strive to meet or exceed industry and regulatory standards for ethical business practices, product responsibility, and supplier management.  All of Xilinx's directors, officers and employees are required to comply not only with the letter of the laws, rules and regulations that govern the conduct of our business, but also with the spirit of those laws.

Environment

We continually monitor regulatory requirement and resource trends in order to identify, manage and control activities that have an environmental impact. We focus on the conservation of energy and natural resources, reducing the solid and chemical waste of our operations, avoiding and preventing pollution and minimizing our overall environmental impact with regards to the communities around us and consistent with global climate change efforts.

Community

We are committed to growing strategic relationships with a wide range of local organizations and programs that are designed to develop and strengthen communities located around the world. Xilinx develops local community relationships at key sites through funding and involvement that encourages active participation, teamwork, and volunteerism. Xilinx supports opportunities initiated by its employees and that involve participation and empowerment of its employees. We are committed to charitable giving programs that work towards systemic change and measurable results.

Workplace

We provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. Employee diversity and inclusion are embraced and opportunities for training, growth, and advancement are strongly encouraged.  The Xilinx Code of Social Responsibility outlines standards to ensure that working conditions at Xilinx are safe and that workers are treated with respect, fairness and dignity.

To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities from the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all of our employees have been working remotely since mid-March 2020. We have long had a business continuity plan in place for unforeseeable situations and, over the years, have invested in technology that would provide our employees the flexibility and security to work effectively and remotely in case of business disruptions.

Employees

As of March 28, 2020, we had 4,891 employees compared to 4,433 as of the end of the prior fiscal year. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and believe we maintain good employee relations.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading multi-national healthcare enterprise that is committed to helping people live healthier lives. We take a local approach - with local brands and local teams - to provide fully integrated, high-quality, and cost-effective services to government-sponsored and commercial healthcare programs, focusing on under-insured and uninsured individuals. We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services. We believe our local approach, including member and provider services, enables us to provide accessible, quality, culturally-sensitive healthcare coverage to our communities. Our population health management, educational and other initiatives are designed to help members best utilize the healthcare system to ensure they receive appropriate, medically necessary services and effective management of routine, severe and chronic health problems, resulting in better health outcomes. We combine our decentralized local approach for care with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance, information systems and claims processing.

Our initial health plan commenced operations in Wisconsin in 1984. We were organized in Wisconsin in 1993 as a holding company for our initial health plan and reincorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "CNC."

We operate in two segments: Managed Care and Specialty Services. Our Managed Care segment provides health plan coverage to individuals through government subsidized and commercial programs. Our Specialty Services segment includes companies offering diversified healthcare services and products to our Managed Care segment and other external customers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our Managed Care and Specialty Services segments accounted for 96% and 4%, respectively, of our total external revenues. Our membership totaled 25.5 million as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our total revenues and net earnings attributable to Centene were $111.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and our total cash flow from operations was $5.5 billion.

Magellan Acquisition

In January 2021, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire Magellan Health for $95.00 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $2.2 billion. The transaction, which was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, is expected to broaden and deepen our whole health capabilities and establish a leading behavioral health platform. The transaction is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act, receipt of required state regulatory approvals, the approval of the definitive merger agreement by Magellan Health's stockholders and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is not contingent upon financing. We intend to fund the acquisition primarily through debt financing. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021.

WellCare Acquisition

On January 23, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of WellCare Health Plans, Inc. (WellCare, and such acquisition, the WellCare Acquisition). The transaction was valued at $19.6 billion, including the assumption of $1.95 billion of outstanding debt. The WellCare Acquisition brought a high-quality Medicare platform and further extended our robust Medicaid offerings. The WellCare Acquisition also enables us to provide access to more comprehensive and differentiated solutions across more markets with a continued focus on affordable, high-quality, culturally-sensitive healthcare services. With the WellCare Acquisition, we further broadened our product offerings by adding a Medicare prescription drug plan to our existing business lines.

INDUSTRY

We provide a full spectrum of managed healthcare products and services, primarily through Medicaid, Medicare and commercial products. We currently have operations domestically and internationally.

Medicaid

Established in 1965, Medicaid is the largest publicly funded program in the United States, and provides health insurance to low-income families and individuals with disabilities. Authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, Medicaid is an entitlement program funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states. The majority of funding is provided by the federal government. Each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages, payment
1

Table of Contents
rates and program administration within federal standards. As a result, there are 56 Medicaid programs - one for each U.S. state, each U.S. territory and the District of Columbia. Eligibility is based on a combination of household income and assets, often determined by an income level relative to the federal poverty level. Historically, children have represented the largest eligibility group. Many states have selected Medicaid managed care as a means of delivering quality healthcare and controlling costs. We refer to these states as mandatory managed care states.

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Medicaid coverage was expanded to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, subject to the states' elections. The federal government paid the entire costs for Medicaid Expansion coverage for newly eligible beneficiaries from 2014 through 2016, 95% of the costs in 2017, 94% of the costs in 2018, 93% of the costs in 2019, and 90% of the costs in 2020. Assuming that the current program remains in effect unchanged, in subsequent years the federal share is scheduled to remain at 90%.

Established in 1972 and authorized by Title XVI of the Social Security Act, the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (ABD) program covers low-income persons with chronic physical disabilities or behavioral health impairments. ABD beneficiaries represent a growing portion of all Medicaid recipients. In addition, ABD recipients typically utilize more services as a result of their more complicated health status. 

The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford private health insurance. Costs related to the largest eligibility group, children, are primarily composed of pediatrics and family care. These costs tend to be more predictable than those associated with other healthcare issues which predominantly affect the adult population.

Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS) is a Medicaid product that covers Institutional/Residential Care (Nursing Facilities, Intermediate Care Facilities) and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) for beneficiaries requiring assistance with their activities of daily living, such as bathing, dressing and transferring. The most common HCBS services include personal care, adult day care, non-emergent transportation, home-delivered meals and personal emergency response systems. LTSS services are provided for individuals requiring nursing home level of care, receiving waiver services, or entitled to state Medicaid LTSS benefits. The largest groups receiving LTSS, by spending, are older individuals and individuals with physical disabilities, followed by individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, those with serious mental illness and/or serious emotional disturbance and other populations. States are increasingly turning to managed care as a solution to provide coordinated, holistic care to their LTSS beneficiaries. According to ADvancing States (formerly National Association of States United for Aging and Disabilities), as of November 2020, 25 states utilize some form of managed LTSS, up from eight in 2004.

The majority of youth and children in foster care qualify for Medicaid, most commonly through Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, which provides funding to support safe and stable out-of-home care for children who are removed from their homes. The federal government has enacted legislation establishing guidelines and requirements for state child welfare agencies related to the health and well-being of children in foster care, including the provision of grants and technical assistance to enable states to meet these needs and make explicit connections with state Medicaid. In addition, the ACA requires states to make former foster care children eligible for Medicaid until they reach the age of 26, provided that they turned 18 while in foster care, and were enrolled in Medicaid at that time.

CMS estimated the total Medicaid market to be approximately $649 billion in 2020, and estimates the market will grow to over $1.0 trillion by 2028. Medicaid spending is estimated to have increased by 4.5% in 2020 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 5.7% between 2020 and 2028. Due to the timing of the CMS report and highly uncertain nature of the pandemic, the aforementioned projections do not take into account the impact of COVID-19.

A portion of Medicaid beneficiaries are dual-eligible, low-income seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare. According to CMS, there were approximately 11.0 million dual-eligible enrollees in 2019. These dual-eligible members may receive assistance from Medicaid for benefits, such as nursing home care, HCBS, and/or assistance with Medicare premiums and cost sharing. Dual-eligibles also use more services due to their tendency to have more chronic health issues. We serve dual-eligibles through our ABD, LTSS, Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMP), Medicare Advantage Dual Special Needs Plan (DSNP) and standard Medicare Advantage lines of business.

While Medicaid programs have directed funds to many individuals who cannot afford or otherwise maintain health insurance coverage, they did not initially address the inefficient and costly manner in which the Medicaid population tends to access healthcare. Medicaid recipients in non-managed care programs typically have not sought preventive care or routine treatment for chronic conditions, such as asthma and diabetes. Rather, they have sought healthcare in hospital emergency departments, which is typically more expensive. As a result, many states without managed care programs have found that the costs of providing Medicaid benefits have increased while the medical outcomes for the recipients remained unsatisfactory.

Table of Contents

We believe managed care has improved the quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries and lowered costs. The majority of states have mandated that their Medicaid recipients enroll in managed care plans. Other states are considering moving to a mandated managed care approach for additional populations and products. As a result, we believe a significant market opportunity exists for managed care organizations with operations and programs focused on the distinct socio-economic, cultural and healthcare needs of the uninsured population and the Medicaid populations.

Medicare

We contract with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program to provide Medicare Advantage products directly to Medicare beneficiaries as well as through employer and union groups. The Medicare program provides health care coverage primarily to individuals age 65 or older, as well as to individuals with certain disabilities.

We provide or arrange healthcare benefits for services normally covered by Medicare, plus a broad range of healthcare benefits for services not covered by traditional Medicare, usually in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per member from CMS that varies based upon the county in which the member resides, demographic factors of the member such as age, gender and institutionalized status, and the health status of the member. Any benefits that are not covered by Medicare may result in an additional monthly premium charged to the enrollee or through portions of payments received from CMS that may be allocated to these benefits, according to CMS regulations and guidance. Many of our Medicare Advantage members pay no monthly premium to us for these additional benefits. As our Medicare Advantage members reach their deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, our medical costs rise, creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year.

We provide a wide range of Medicare products, including Medicare Advantage plans with and without prescription drug coverage and Medicare supplement products that supplement traditional fee-for-service Medicare coverage. Our subsidiaries have a number of contracts with CMS under the Medicare Advantage program authorized under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act.

CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans, awarding between 1.0 and 5.0 stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality. The Star ratings are used by CMS to award quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans. Beginning with the 2014 Star ratings (calculated in 2013), Medicare Advantage plans are required to achieve a minimum of 4.0 Stars to qualify for a quality bonus payment. The methodology and measures included in the Star ratings system can be modified by CMS annually and Star ratings thresholds are based on performance of Medicare Advantage plans nationally.

CMS estimated the total Medicare market was approximately $859 billion in 2020, and estimates the market will grow to approximately $1.6 trillion by 2028. Medicare spending is estimated to have increased 7.2% in fiscal 2020 and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of 7.7% between 2020 and 2028.

Medicare Prescription Drug Plan

Through our acquisition of WellCare in January 2020, we now offer stand-alone PDP to Medicare beneficiaries. We have contracted with CMS to serve as a plan sponsor, offering stand-alone Medicare Part D PDP plans to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. We offer PDPs in 50 states and the District of Columbia. Our PDPs offer national in-network prescription drug coverage, including a preferred pharmacy network, subject to limitations in certain circumstances.

Our PDP contracts with CMS are renewable for successive one-year terms unless CMS notifies us of its decision not to renew by May 1 of the current contract year or we notify CMS of our decision not to renew by the first Monday in June of the contract year.

The Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit is supported by risk sharing with the federal government through risk corridors designed to limit the losses and gains of the participating drug plans and by reinsurance for catastrophic drug costs. The government subsidy is based on the national weighted average monthly bid for this coverage, adjusted for risk factor payments. Additional subsidies are provided for dually-eligible beneficiaries and specified low-income beneficiaries.

Commercial

Established in 2010 and operational in 2014, the ACA created Health Insurance Marketplaces, which are a key component of the ACA and provide an opportunity for individuals and families to obtain health insurance. States have the option of operating
3

Table of Contents
their own Marketplace or partnering with the federal government. States choosing neither option currently default to a federally-facilitated Marketplace. Premium subsidies are available to make coverage more affordable. Access to Marketplaces is limited to U.S. citizens and legal immigrants. Insurers are required to offer a minimum level of benefits with coverage that varies based on premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Premium subsidies are provided to individuals and families without access to other coverage and with incomes generally between 100-400% of the federal poverty level, with some exceptions, to help them purchase insurance through the Marketplaces. These subsidies are offered on a sliding scale basis.

We also offer commercial healthcare products to individuals through large and small employer groups. We offer plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of co-payments at different premium rates. These plans are offered generally through contracts with participating network physicians, hospitals and other providers. Coverage typically is subject to copays and can be subject to deductibles and coinsurance. As our commercial members reach their deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, our medical costs rise, creating seasonality in the business with a higher percentage of earnings in the first half of the year.

International

We have a growing international presence in Spain, the United Kingdom (UK) and Slovakia. Our presence in Spain is mainly associated with our subsidiaries operating as part of the Ribera Salud Group, which manages health administration concessions and private hospitals in various regions in Spain. Ribera Salud Group also holds a noncontrolling investment in Slovakia, which provides radiology services in the region. In the UK, our subsidiaries, operating as part of Operose Health Group, represent one of the largest provider networks in the country and deliver medical and community based services in the primary care sector of the National Health Service (NHS), which is the publicly funded, national healthcare system for England. We also have a noncontrolling investment in the UK in Circle Health Group, which includes BMI Healthcare and represents the UK’s largest independent hospital operator.

OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS

Our approach is based on the following key competitive strengths:

•Expertise in Government Sponsored Programs. For more than 35 years, we have developed a specialized services expertise that has helped us establish and maintain relationships with members, providers and our government customers. We have implemented programs developed to achieve savings for our government customers and support providers with tools and information to improve health outcomes and quality of care for members. We work to assist the states in which we operate in addressing the operating challenges they face.

•Quality and Innovation. Our innovative population health management programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members. We concentrate on serving the whole person to impact outcomes and costs. We recognize the importance of member-focused delivery of quality managed care services and have developed award winning education and outreach programs including the My Health Pays program, Start Smart for Your Baby, Living Well with Sickle Cell, Fluvention and MemberConnections. It is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members. As a validation of that objective, we pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality. We seek the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC) Health Plan Accreditation in eligible states.

•Innovative Technology and Scalable Systems. The ability to access data and translate it into meaningful information is essential to operating across a multi-state service area in a cost-effective manner. Our centralized information systems support our core processing functions under a set of integrated databases and are designed to be both replicable and scalable to accommodate organic growth and growth from acquisitions. We continue to enhance our systems in order to leverage the platforms we have developed for our existing states for configuration into new states or health plan acquisitions. We believe our predictive modeling technology enables our population health management operations to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members. It can recommend medical care opportunities using a mix of company defined algorithms and evidence based medical guidelines. Interventions are determined by the clinical indicators, the ability to improve health outcomes, and the risk profile of members. We believe our integrated approach helps to assure that consistent sources of claim and member information are provided across all of our health plans. Our membership and claims processing systems are capable of expanding to support additional members in an efficient manner.

•Financial Strength and Scale. We are a large healthcare enterprise with $111.1 billion in revenue and $5.5 billion in operating cash flow in 2020. Our strong historical operating performance, size, and scale allow us to continue to grow, diversify and invest in our businesses through strategic acquisitions and investments in technology and other resources that support our business, allowing us to navigate the changing healthcare landscape. We are a leader in the four largest Medicaid states. We seek to continue to increase our Medicaid, Medicare and Health Insurance Marketplace membership through alliances with key providers, outreach efforts, development and implementation of community-specific products and acquisitions. In 2020, we expanded our Health Insurance Marketplace footprints in several existing markets, and we completed the WellCare Acquisition, further expanding our scale and presence. In addition, in 2019 a nationally recognized statistical rating organization raised our long-term issuer credit rating to an investment grade rating.

•Diversified Business Lines. We continue to broaden our service offerings to address areas that we believe have been traditionally under-served by Medicaid and Medicare managed care organizations. In addition to our Medicaid and Medicare services, our service offerings include commercial programs, PDP, correctional healthcare services, government-sponsored care under federal contracts with the Department of Defense (DoD), and other various specialty services. Through the utilization of a multi-business line approach, we are able to improve the quality of care, improve outcomes, diversify our revenues and help control our medical costs. In 2020, we served members in all 50 states through approximately 450 product solutions. We are constantly evaluating new opportunities for expansion both domestically and abroad.

•Localized Approach with Centralized Support Infrastructure. We take a localized approach to managing our subsidiaries, including provider and member services. This approach enables us to facilitate access by our members to high quality, culturally sensitive healthcare services. Our systems and procedures have been designed to address these community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation and other member support activities. For example, our community outreach programs work with our members and their communities to promote health and self-improvement through education on how best to access care. We complement this localized approach with a centralized infrastructure of support functions such as finance, information systems and claims processing, which allows us to minimize selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and to integrate and realize synergies from acquisitions. We believe this combined approach allows us to efficiently integrate new business opportunities in both Managed Care and Specialty Services, while maintaining our local accountability and improved access.

MANAGED CARE

Benefits to Customers

We feel that our ability to establish and maintain a leadership position in the markets we serve results primarily from our demonstrated success in providing quality care while reducing and managing costs, and from our specialized programs with state governments. Among the benefits we are able to provide to the states with which we contract are:

•Significant cost savings and budget predictability compared to state paid reimbursement for services. We bring experience relating to quality of care improvement methods, utilization management procedures, an efficient claims payment system, and provider performance reporting, as well as managers and staff experienced in using these key elements to improve the quality of and access to care. We generally receive a contracted premium on a per member basis and are responsible for the medical costs and, as a result, provide budget predictability.

•Data-driven approaches to balance cost and verify eligibility. We seek to ensure effective outreach procedures for new members, then educate them and ensure they receive needed services as quickly as possible. Our IT department has created mapping/translation programs for loading membership and linking membership eligibility status to all of Centene's systems. We utilize predictive modeling technology to proactively case and disease manage specific high risk members. In addition, we have developed Centelligence, our enterprise data warehouse system to provide a seamless flow of data across our organization, enabling providers and case managers to access information, apply analytical insight and make informed decisions.

•Establishment of realistic and meaningful expectations for quality deliverables. We have collaborated with state agencies in redefining benefits, eligibility requirements and provider fee schedules with the goal of maximizing the number of individuals covered through Medicaid.

•Managed care expertise in government subsidized programs. Our expertise in Medicaid has helped us establish and maintain strong relationships with our constituent communities of members, providers and state governments. We
5

Table of Contents
provide access to services through local providers and staff that focus on the cultural norms of their individual communities. To that end, systems and procedures have been designed to address community-specific challenges through outreach, education, transportation and other member support activities.

•Improved quality and medical outcomes. We have implemented programs to enhance the ability of providers to improve the quality of healthcare delivered to our members. This is demonstrated through health plan accreditations and program awards.

•Timely payment of provider claims. We are committed to ensuring that our information systems and claims payment systems meet or exceed state requirements. We continuously endeavor to update our systems and processes to improve the timeliness of our provider payments.

•Provider outreach and programs. Our health plans have adopted a physician-driven approach where network providers are actively engaged in developing and implementing healthcare delivery policies and strategies. We prepare provider comparisons on a severity adjusted basis. This approach is designed to eliminate unnecessary costs, improve services to members and simplify the administrative burdens placed on providers.

•Care management for complex populations. Through our experience with Medicaid populations and long-time presence in states with experience in long-term care for children and adolescents in the foster care system, we have developed care management, service coordination and crisis prevention/response programs that increase opportunities for successful outcomes for members. This experience has led to partnerships with specialized networks and community advocates as states transition to managed care programs for vulnerable and complex populations.

•Responsible collection and dissemination of utilization data. We gather utilization data from multiple sources, allowing for an integrated view of our members' utilization of services. These sources include medical, vision and behavioral health claims and encounter data, pharmacy data, dental vendor claims and authorization data from the authorization and case management system utilized by us to coordinate care.

•Timely and accurate reporting. Our information systems have reporting capabilities which have been instrumental in identifying the need for new and/or improved healthcare and specialty programs. For state agencies, our reporting capability is important in demonstrating an auditable program.

•Fraud, waste and abuse prevention. We have several systems in place to help identify, detect and investigate potential fraud, waste, and abuse, including pre- and post-payment review software. We collaborate with state and federal agencies and assist with investigation requests. We use nationally recognized standards to benchmark our processes. 

Member Programs and Services

We recognize the importance of member-focused delivery of quality managed care services. Our locally-based staff assists members in accessing care, coordinating referrals to related health and social services and addressing member concerns and questions. While covered healthcare benefits vary from customer to customer and program to program, our health plans generally provide the following services:

•primary and specialty physician care;
•inpatient and outpatient hospital care;
•emergency and urgent care;
•prenatal and postpartum care;
•laboratory and x-ray services;
•home-based primary care;
•transportation assistance;
•vision care;
•dental care;

•24-hour nurse advice line;
•therapies;
•social work services; and
•care coordination.

We also provide a comprehensive set of education and outreach programs to inform, assist and incentivize members to access quality, appropriate healthcare services in an efficient manner. Many of these programs have been recognized with awards for their excellence in education, outreach and/or case management techniques. These awards include Case In Point, Hermes Awards, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and National Health Information Awards.

•Start Smart for Your Baby, or Start Smart, is our award winning prenatal and infant health program designed to increase the percentage of pregnant people receiving early prenatal care, reduce the incidence of low-birth-weight and pre-term babies, identify high-risk pregnancies, increase participation in the federal Women, Infant and Children program, prevent hospital admissions in the first year of life and increase well-child visits. The Neonatal Admissions program is an extension of the Start Smart for Your Baby program with a focus on newborns who have a hospital stay longer than standard after delivery, including those with admissions to the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The program strives for timely identification of neonatal admissions to coordinate care and provide member education, resources and member-specific care plans to keep both birth parent and baby safe and healthy in the home environment upon discharge from the hospital.

•Readmission Reduction aims to reduce preventable readmissions by ensuring optimal transitional care from acute and non-acute settings. The program focuses on post-hospitalization outreach (PHO), calls to members to verify they understand their discharge instructions, follow up with a Primary Care Physician (PCP), receive medication reconciliation, and, for the highest-risk members, are linked with a Community Health Worker.

•Chronic Conditions aims to improve the health and quality of life for members with diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and/or hypertension. The program focuses on reducing emergent utilization and inpatient admissions by increasing treatment adherence, removing barriers to care, and enhancing self-management skills.

•Fall Prevention seeks to decrease the number and severity of older adult falls. The program also aims to support members in maintaining their safety, stability, and independence as long as possible. The program leverages an evidence-based falls prevention toolkit to identify members at risk of falling and provide education and interventions to reduce fall risk.

•Compassionate Connections (Palliative Care) works to identify members with at least one serious illness and provide necessary services to both members and those individuals close to them. Potential services may include detailed advanced care planning, a multi-team home visit and home health services, and additional social support. Providing palliative care services works to help alleviate members' suffering, and in turn, provide a better quality of life.

•Emergency Department Diversion strives to identify members' reasons for visiting the emergency department and connect them with the right care, at the right time, in the right place in the future. The program also identifies opportunities for members to better manage their chronic conditions with the help of PCPs and Care Managers.

•Fluvention works to decrease the spread of the flu by increasing the number of members that receive a timely annual flu vaccination. This multi-layered campaign is designed to promote vaccinations as the key to flu prevention. Centene works to address these issues by utilizing enterprise-wide member and provider marketing and education, as well as increasing access to facilities that provide flu vaccinations.

•Connections Plus is a cell phone program developed for high-risk members who have limited or no safe and reliable access to telephone. This program seeks to eliminate lack of safe, reliable access to a telephone as a barrier to coordinating care, thus reducing avoidable adverse events such as inappropriate emergency department utilization, hospital admissions and premature birth.

•MemberConnections is a community face-to-face outreach and education program designed to create a link between the member, provider and the care team to help identify potential challenges or risk elements to a member's health, such as nutritional challenges and health education gaps.

Goals of the program include preventing premature treatment discontinuation due to medication side effects and access to therapy. Through its family of companies, Envolve clinicians and AcariaHealth patient care coordinators collaborate throughout a patient's treatment course to ensure appropriate therapy management and regimen access.

•Health Initiatives for Children is aimed at educating child members on a variety of health topics. In order to empower and educate children, we have partnered with a nationally recognized children's author to develop our own children's book series on topics such as obesity prevention and healthy eating, asthma, diabetes, foster care, the ills of smoking, anti-bullying and heart health.

•OpiEnd Youth Challenge is a targeted curriculum for adolescents ages 9 through 14 to raise awareness about opioid misuse and prevention. As part of the challenge, teachers and students discuss significant attributes of addiction and opioid misuse, and students then show their understanding by developing and submitting campaign messaging that depicts ways to prevent misuse.

•Health Initiatives for Teens is aimed at empowering, educating and reinforcing life skills with our teenage members. We have developed an educational series that addresses health issues, dealing with chronic diseases including diabetes and asthma, as well as teen pregnancy.

•Living Well with Sickle Cell is our innovative program that assists with coordination of care for our members with sickle cell disease. Our program ensures that members with sickle cell disease have established a medical home and work on strategies to reduce emergency department visits through disease self-management strategies, medication adherence and proper treatment to control symptoms, pain and chronic complications.

•My Route for Health is our adult educational series used with our case management and disease management programs. The topics of this series include how to manage asthma, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), diabetes, heart disease and HIV.

•Community Health Record, our patient-centric electronic database, collects patient demographic data, clinician visit records, dispensed medications, vital sign history, lab results, allergy charts, and immunization data. Providers can directly input additional or updated patient data and documentation into the database. All information is accessible anywhere, anytime to all authorized users, including health plan staff, greatly facilitating coordinated care among providers.

•My Health Pays offers members financial incentives for performing certain healthy behaviors. The incentives are delivered through a restricted-use prepaid debit card. This incentive-based approach effectively increases the utilization of preventive services while strengthening the relationships between members and their primary care providers.

•The Asthma Management Program integrates a hands-on approach with a flexible outreach methodology that can be customized to suit different age groups and populations affected by asthma. We provide proactive identification of members, stratification into appropriate levels of intervention including home visits, culturally sensitive education, and robust outcome reporting. The program also includes aggressive care coordination to ensure patients have basic services such as transportation to the doctor, electricity to power the nebulizer, and a clean, safe home environment.

•Preventive Care Programs are designed to educate our members on the benefits of Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis and Treatment (EPSDT) services. We have a systematic program of communicating, tracking, outreach, reporting and follow-through that promotes state EPSDT programs.

•Outcomes Improvement Central (OIC) is a highly collaborative initiative that empowers partners across the organization to develop evidence-based clinical programs to promote best practice information sharing, and to establish measurable outcomes for clinical studies. The OIC also serves as a repository of enterprise pilots and programs intended to improve the members' health outcomes.

•Promotores Health Network (PHN) is a volunteer-driven community health network designed to improve the community's health through health education specific to health conditions impacting their community and providing guidance and linkage to healthcare services and local resources.

•OpiEnd is a clinical program designed to identify members at risk for an opioid abuse diagnosis based on a series of critical social and clinical indicators called the Opioid Risk Classification Algorithm (ORCA). Providers will leverage this risk score to flag members for case management and other appropriate interventions. High risk members identified by ORCA will receive educational outreach to provide evidenced-based resources to support pain addiction.

•Strong Beginnings addresses the rising US rates of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS). The program aims to support pregnant people at risk for substance use disorder through case management and care coordination, and to support their providers through incentives and plan of safe care guidance.

Providers

For each of our service areas, we establish a provider network consisting of primary and specialty care physicians, hospitals and ancillary providers. Our network of primary care physicians is a critical component of care delivery, cost management and the attraction and retention of new members. Primary care physicians include family and general practitioners, pediatricians, internal medicine physicians and obstetricians and gynecologists. Specialty care physicians provide medical care to members generally upon referral by primary care physicians. Specialty care physicians include, but are not limited to, orthopedic surgeons, cardiologists and otolaryngologists. We also provide education and outreach programs to inform and assist members in accessing quality, appropriate healthcare services. 

Our health plans facilitate access to healthcare services for our members primarily through contracts with our providers. Our contracts with primary and specialty care physicians and hospitals usually are for one to three-year periods and renew automatically for successive one-year terms, but generally are subject to termination by either party upon prior written notice. In the absence of a contract, we typically pay providers at applicable state or federal reimbursement levels, depending on the product (e.g., Medicaid or Medicare). We pay providers under a variety of methods, including fee-for-service, capitation arrangements, and value-based arrangements.

•Under our fee-for-service contracts with providers, we pay a negotiated fee for covered services. This model is characterized as having no financial risk for the provider.

•Under our capitated contracts, providers can be paid a set amount for their services as outlined in their respective provider agreements. A provider group's financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us, even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group. Depending on state law and the regulatory environment, it may be necessary for us to pay such claims.

•Under value-based arrangements, providers can be paid under either a capitated or fee-for-service model. The arrangement, however, contains provisions for additional payments to the providers or reimbursement from the providers based upon their performance in cost and quality measures.

In addition, we maintain a network of qualified physicians, facilities, and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our TRICARE contract. Services are provided on a fee-for-service basis.

We often start our provider relationships in a pay-for-performance arrangement before we transition to a risk-sharing arrangement, which is based on the total cost of care. As we advance along this continuum, it strengthens our partnerships with our providers, enabling the delivery of high quality care.

We work with physicians to help them operate efficiently by providing actionable financial and utilization information, physician and patient educational programs and disease and population health management programs. Our programs are also designed to help physicians coordinate care rendered by other providers.

We believe our local and collaborative approach with physicians and other providers gives us a competitive advantage in entering new markets. Our physicians serve on local committees that assist us in implementing preventive care programs, managing costs and improving the overall quality of care delivered to our members, while also simplifying the administrative

Table of Contents
burdens on our providers. This approach has enabled us to strengthen our provider networks through improved physician recruitment and retention that, in turn, has helped to increase our membership base. The following are among the services we provide to support physicians:

•Provider Engagement Performance Tools and Processes lead to measurable improvements in quality and health outcomes, healthcare costs, and member satisfaction. High quality and service levels are important as our key customers are increasingly using performance-based measures to select and pay health plans. We have a suite of network performance tools for use by physicians and other providers which monitor the outcomes and care gaps of their individual patient panels. We meet with the providers to review their performance issues and recommend strategies for improvements in their patient panel outcomes. Our tools also allow the physician and others to see where they stand within their value-based contract.

•Integrated Care Model is member-centric and managed by one care manager assigned to a member who looks at the total care for the member in a holistic manner. This single care manager will coordinate all care for that member including behavioral health, medical health, and home-based primary care in accordance with an individualized, integrated care plan. This care manager also coordinates meetings with the member's integrated care team to assess and alter the care plan as needed. This results in better outcomes and improvement in member satisfaction.

•Provider Portal provides claims and eligibility research, prior authorizations, member panels, care gaps, patient analytics, and provider analytics meant to drive provider engagement and improved patient outcomes. Data and reporting are delivered via a secure, user-friendly web-based provider portal. This is provided through our suite of proprietary technology developed by Interpreta, Apixio and Casenet.

Our contracted physicians also benefit from several of the services offered to our members, including the MemberConnections, EPSDT case management and population health management programs. For example, the MemberConnections staff facilitates doctor/patient relationships by connecting members with physicians, the EPSDT programs encourage routine checkups for children with their physicians and the population health management programs assist physicians in managing their patients with chronic disease.

Where appropriate, our health plans contract with our specialty services organizations to provide services and programs such as care management software, dental benefits management, home-based primary care services, life and population health management, managed vision, pharmacy benefits management, specialty pharmacy and telehealth services. When necessary, we also contract with third-party providers on a negotiated fee arrangement for physical therapy, home healthcare, diagnostic laboratory tests, x-ray examinations, transportation, ambulance services and durable medical equipment.

Quality Management

Our population health programs focus on improving quality of care in areas that have the greatest impact on our members. We employ strategies, including complex case management, which are adjusted for implementation in our individual markets by a system of physician committees chaired by local physician leaders. This process promotes physician participation and support, both critical factors in the success of any clinical quality improvement program.

We have implemented specialized information systems to support our quality management activities. Information is drawn from our data warehouse, clinical databases and our membership and claims processing system to identify opportunities to improve care and to track the outcomes of the interventions implemented to achieve those improvements. Some examples of these programs include:

•use of nationally recognized InterQual or Milliman criteria to help ensure our members receive the right level of care in the most appropriate setting;

•pre-authorized high-risk medication and services that are commonly over or inappropriately prescribed;

•member education and the provision of appropriate and easily accessed urgent care services to help members avoid unnecessary and costly emergency department visits and improve their healthcare experience;

•emphasis on care management and care coordination where clinicians, such as nurses and social workers who are employed to assist high-risk and other selected members with the coordination of healthcare services that meet their specific needs;

Table of Contents
•disease management for chronic illnesses, such as asthma and diabetes through a comprehensive, multidisciplinary and collaborative approach;

•prenatal case management for those with high-risk pregnancies to help them deliver full-term, healthy infants; and

•pharmacy treatment compliance programs driven by evidence-based clinical policies and focused on identifying the appropriate medication in the correct dose, delivered in an efficient format and utilized for the correct duration.

We provide reporting on a regular basis using our data warehouse. State and Health Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) reporting constitutes the core of the information base that drives our clinical quality performance efforts. This reporting is monitored by health plan quality improvement committees and our corporate population health management and quality improvement teams. 

In an effort to ensure the quality of our provider networks, we verify the credentials and background of our providers using standards that are supported by NCQA.

It is our objective to provide access to the highest quality of care for our members. As a validation of that objective, we pursue accreditation by independent organizations that have been established to promote healthcare quality. NCQA Health Plan Accreditation and URAC Health Plan Accreditation programs provide unbiased, third party reviews to verify and publicly report results on specific quality care metrics. While we have achieved or are pursuing accreditation for all of our plans, accreditation is only one measure of our ability to provide access to quality care for our members. We have achieved accreditation in 30 of 33 eligible states for at least one product (Medicare, Medicaid, or Commercial, including Health Insurance Marketplace).

CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star ratings system to help consumers choose among competing plans, awarding between 1.0 and 5.0 stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in certain measures of quality.

•For the 2020 Star rating (calculated in 2019 for the quality bonus payment in 2021), two contracts received a 4.5 out of 5.0 Stars, two contracts received 4.0 Stars, four contracts received 3.5 Stars, and seven contracts received 3.0 Stars. In addition, for the 2020 Star rating, we carry a 3.5 Star parent organization rating. Approximately 46% of our Medicare members are in a 4 star or above plan for the 2021 bonus year.

•For the 2021 Star rating (calculated in 2020 for the quality bonus payment in 2022), two contracts received 4.5 out of 5.0 Stars, three contracts received 4.0 Stars, 17 contracts received 3.5 Stars, and 13 contracts received 3.0 Stars. In addition, for the 2021 Star rating, we carry a 3.5 Star parent organization rating. Approximately 30% of our Medicare members are in a 4 star or above plan for the 2022 bonus year.

The parent organization Star rating is used for new Medicare contracts, while existing contracts follow their individual Star ratings to determine bonus payments. We remain committed to our quality initiatives and continue to invest in the programs which we expect to translate into value over the next few years.

CORPORATE COMPLIANCE

Our Ethics and Compliance program assists the organization in developing effective internal controls that promote prevention and detection of fraud, waste and abuse and resolution of instances of conduct that do not conform to federal and state law and private payor healthcare program requirements, as well as our own ethics and business policies. Responsibilities also include the ongoing maintenance of our privacy program and oversight of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) as they pertain to us and our business units from a compliance, business, and technical perspective.

Three standards by which corporate compliance programs in the healthcare industry are measured are the Federal Organizational Sentencing Guidelines, the CMS Chapter Guidance and the Compliance Program Guidance series issued by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of the Inspector General (OIG). Our program contains each of the seven elements suggested by these authorities. These key components are:

•written standards of conduct;
•designation of compliance officers and compliance committees;
•effective training and education;
•effective lines for reporting and communication;
•enforcement of standards through well-publicized disciplinary guidelines and actions;
•internal monitoring and auditing; and
•prompt response to detected offenses and development of corrective action plans.

The goal of our program is to build a culture of ethics and compliance, which is assessed periodically to measure the values and engagement of the organization. Our Corporate Compliance intranet site, accessible to all employees, contains our Compliance Program description, our Business Ethics and Code of Conduct Policy, and resources for employees to report concerns or ask questions. If needed, employees have access to the contact information for our Board of Directors' Audit Committee Chairman to report concerns. Our Ethics and Compliance Helpline is a toll-free number and web-based reporting tool operated by a third party independent of the Company and allows employees or other persons to report suspected incidents of misconduct, fraud, waste, abuse or other compliance violations anonymously. Furthermore, our Board of Directors has established a Corporate Compliance Committee that, among other things, reviews ethics and compliance reports on a quarterly basis.

ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, HEALTH, GOVERNANCE AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

Centene's steadfast commitment to the environment, the health and social well-being of our communities, and our culture of sound and ethical corporate governance extends far beyond individual programs or initiatives. Through the delivery of high-quality healthcare to at-risk populations, our responsibilities to members, stakeholders, and our planet serve as a living expression of our purpose – transforming the health of communities, one person at a time. Continued focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters remain foundational to supporting our strategy and long-term value creation. These themes were vital as executive leaders from across the enterprise completed an ESG assessment early in 2020. The results of this work led to the development of Centene's Environmental, Social, Health, and Governance (ESHG) Strategic Framework (the Framework), which incorporates our commitment to healthy individuals and healthy communities. Also in 2020, we formed a board-level Environmental and Social Responsibility Committee to oversee implementation of the Framework and formalized a cross-functional work group comprised of executive representatives to advance ESHG initiatives throughout the organization. In December 2020, we issued a Report to the Community to communicate the value of our ESHG efforts. The formalization of Centene’s ESHG Framework enables us to align our business strategy and long-term planning with our commitments to protect our planet, serve our communities, cultivate healthier lives, and live our values. Interested parties can find our December 2020 Environmental, Social, Health and Governance Report within the Investors section of our website, the URL of which is https://www.centene.com/who-we-are/corporate-facts-reports.html. Nothing on our website, including our Environmental, Social, Health and Governance Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.

COMPETITION

We operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry subject to ongoing significant changes, including business consolidations, new strategic alliances, market pressures, and regulatory and legislative reform both at the federal and state level. This includes, but is not limited to, the federal and state healthcare reform legislation described under the heading "Regulation." In addition, changes to the political environment may drive additional changes to the competitive landscape.

13

Table of Contents
In our business, our principal competitors for customers, members, and providers consist of the following types of organizations: 

•National and Regional Commercial Managed Care Organizations that focus on providing healthcare services to Medicaid, Medicare and correctional members in addition to members in marketplace and private commercial plans. These organizations consist of national and regional organizations, as well as not-for-profits and organizations that operate in a small geographic location and are owned by providers (primarily hospitals). Some of these organizations offer a range of specialty services including pharmacy benefits management, behavioral health management, population health management, correctional healthcare management, and nurse triage call support centers.

•Primary Care Case Management Programs that are established by the states through contracts with primary care providers. Under these programs, physicians provide primary care services to Medicaid recipients, as well as limited population health management oversight.     

•Accountable Care Organizations that consist of groups of doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers, who come together to provide coordinated high quality care to their patients.

We compete with other Managed Care Organizations and specialty companies for state, county, federal, and commercial contracts. In addition, the impact of the ACA and potential growth in our segment may attract new competitors including technology companies, new joint ventures, financial services firms, consulting firms and other non-traditional competitors. Before granting a contract, state and federal government agencies consider many competitive factors. These factors include quality of care, financial condition, stability and resources, and established or scalable infrastructure with a demonstrated ability to deliver services and establish comprehensive provider networks. Our specialty companies compete with other providers, such as disease management companies, individual health insurance companies, and pharmacy benefits managers for non-governmental contracts.

We also compete to enroll new members and retain existing members. People who wish to enroll in a managed healthcare plan or to change healthcare plans typically choose a plan based on the quality of care and services offered, ease of access to services, a specific provider being part of the network and the availability of supplemental benefits. We believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered, size and quality of provider network, quality of service, responsiveness to customer demands, financial stability, comprehensiveness of coverage, diversity of product offerings, market presence and reputation.

We also compete with other managed care organizations in establishing provider networks. When contracting with various health plans, we believe that providers consider existing and potential member volume, reimbursement rates, population health management programs, speed of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities. See "Risk Factors - Competition may limit our ability to increase penetration of the markets that we serve." 

The relative importance of each of the aforementioned competitive factors and the identity of our key competitors varies by market, including by geography and by product. We believe that we compete effectively against other healthcare industry participants.

REGULATION

Our operations are comprehensively regulated at the local, state, and federal levels. Government regulation of the provision of healthcare products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. States have implemented National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model regulations, requiring governance practices and risk and solvency assessment reporting. States have adopted these or similar measures to enhance regulations relating to corporate governance and internal controls of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and insurance companies. We are required to maintain a risk management framework and file reports with state insurance regulators.

Regulatory agencies generally have substantial discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce laws and rules. Changes in the regulatory environment and applicable laws and rules also may occur periodically, including in connection with changes in political party or administration at the state and federal levels. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any potential future legislation enacted under the new administration remains uncertain.

Our regulated subsidiaries are licensed to operate as HMOs, preferred provider organizations (PPOs), third party administrators, utilization review organizations, pharmacies, direct care providers and/or insurance companies in their respective states. In each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, we are regulated by the relevant insurance, health and/or human services departments,
14

Table of Contents
departments of insurance, boards of pharmacy and other healthcare providers, and departments of health that oversee the activities of managed care organizations and health plans providing or arranging to provide services to enrollees.

The process for obtaining authorization to operate as a managed care organization, health insurance plan, prescription drug plan, pharmacy or provider organization is complex and requires us to demonstrate to the regulators the adequacy of the health plan's organizational structure, financial resources, utilization review, quality assurance programs, proper billing, complaint procedures, and an adequate provider network and procedures for covering emergency medical conditions. For example, under both state managed care organization statutes and insurance laws, our health plan subsidiaries, as well as our applicable specialty companies, must comply with minimum statutory capital and other financial solvency requirements, such as deposit and surplus requirements. Insurance regulations may also require prior state approval of acquisitions of other managed care organization businesses and the payment of dividends, as well as notice for loans or the transfer of funds. Our subsidiaries are also subject to periodic state and federal reporting requirements. In addition, each health plan and individual healthcare provider must meet criteria to secure the approval of state regulatory authorities before implementing certain operational changes, including without limitation changes to existing offerings, the development of new product offerings, certain organizational restructurings and, in some states, the expansion of service areas. 

States have adopted a number of regulations that may affect our business and results of operations. These regulations in certain states include:
•premium taxes or similar assessments imposed on us;
•stringent prompt payment laws requiring us to pay claims within a specified period of time;
•disclosure requirements regarding provider fee schedules and coding procedures; and
•programs to monitor and supervise the activities and financial solvency of provider groups.

We are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates. These holding company laws and regulations generally require insurance companies and HMOs within an insurance holding company system to register with the insurance department of each state where they are domiciled and to file with those states' insurance departments reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, intercompany transactions and general business operations. In addition, depending on the size and nature of the transaction, there are various notice and reporting requirements that generally apply to transactions between insurance companies and HMOs and their affiliates within an insurance holding company structure. Some insurance holding company laws and regulations require prior regulatory approval or, in certain circumstances, prior notice of certain material intercompany transfers of assets as well as certain transactions between insurance companies, HMOs, their parent holding companies and affiliates. Among other provisions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends.

Additionally, the holding company regulations of the states in which our subsidiaries are domiciled restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Under those statutes, without such approval or an exemption, no person may acquire any voting security of an insurance holding company, which controls an insurance company or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would "control" the insurance holding company. "Control" is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a company and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of a company.

PPO regulation also varies by state and covers all or most of the subject area referred to above.

Our pharmacies must be licensed to do business as pharmacies in the states in which they are located. Our pharmacies must also register with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and individual state controlled substance authorities to dispense controlled substances. In many of the states where our pharmacies deliver pharmaceuticals, there are laws and regulations that require out-of-state mail order pharmacies to register with that state's board of pharmacy or similar regulatory body. These states generally permit the pharmacy to follow the laws of the state in which the mail order pharmacy is located, although some states require that we also comply with certain laws in that state.

Our healthcare providers must be licensed to practice medicine and do business as care providers in the state in which they are located. In addition, they must be in good standing with the applicable medical board, board of nursing or other applicable entity. Furthermore, they cannot be excluded from participation at either the state or federal levels. Our facilities are periodically reviewed by state departments of health and other regulatory agencies to ensure the environment is safe to provide care.

Federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government, such as the Medicaid and Medicare programs. Our Medicaid programs are regulated and administered by various state regulatory bodies. Federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs. Federal law permits the federal government to oversee and, in some cases, to enact, regulations and other requirements that must be followed by states with respect to these programs. Medicaid is administered at the federal level by CMS. Comprehensive legislation, specifically Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, governs our Medicare program. In addition, our Medicare contracts are subject to regulation by CMS. CMS has the right to audit Medicare contractors and the healthcare providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with CMS contracts and regulations.

The ACA transformed the U.S. healthcare system through a series of complex initiatives. Some of the ACA's most significant provisions include the imposition of significant fees, assessments and taxes, including the non-deductible tax (technically called a "fee") on health insurers based on prior year net premiums written (the "health insurer fee" or "HIF"); the establishment of federally-facilitated and state-based Health Insurance Marketplaces where individuals and small groups may purchase health coverage; the implementation of certain premium stabilization programs designed to apportion risk amongst insurers; and the optional Medicaid Expansion. State and federal regulators have continued to provide additional guidance and specificity to the ACA, and we continue to monitor this new information and evaluate its potential impact on our business. In December 2018, a partial summary judgment ruling in Texas v. United States of America held that the ACA's individual mandate requirement was essential to the ACA, and without it, the remainder of the ACA was invalid (i.e., that it was not "severable" from the ACA). That decision was appealed to the Fifth Circuit, which ruled in December 2019 that the individual mandate was unconstitutional after Congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty, and remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis on the question of severability. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in November 2020 and a ruling is anticipated in 2021. The ACA remains in effect until judicial review of the decision is concluded. For a further discussion of the ACA, see "Risk Factors - The implementation of the ACA, as well as potential repeal of, changes to, or judicial challenges to the ACA, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows".

We must also comply with laws and regulations related to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. Money laundering is a method of attempting to conceal the origins of money gained through illegal activity and is itself a crime that can result in substantial criminal and civil sanctions including fines and imprisonment. To ensure compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations, it is our policy to conduct business only with legitimate customers and counterparties whose funds are derived from legitimate commercial activity. In addition, as a result of our international operations, we are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. A violation of specific laws and regulations by us and/or our agents could result in, among other things, the imposition of fines and penalties on us, changes to our business practices, the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts.

State and Federal Contracts

In addition to being a licensed insurance company or HMO, in order to be a Medicaid managed care organization in each of the states in which we operate, we generally must operate under a contract with the state's Medicaid agency. States generally either use a formal proposal process, reviewing a number of bidders, or award individual contracts to qualified applicants that apply for entry to the program. Under these state Medicaid program contracts, we receive monthly payments based on specified capitation rates determined on an actuarial basis. These rates differ by membership category and by state depending on the specific benefits and policies adopted by each state. In addition, several of our Medicaid contracts require us to maintain Medicare Advantage special needs plans, which are regulated by CMS, for dual eligible individuals within the state.

We provide Medicare Advantage, PDPs, DSNPs, and MMP which are provided under contracts with CMS and subject to federal regulation regarding the award, administration and performance of such contracts. CMS also has the right to audit our performance to determine our compliance with these contracts, as well as other CMS regulations and the quality of care we provide to Medicare beneficiaries under these contracts. We additionally provide behavioral and other healthcare services to correctional systems under contracts in certain states which are also subject to state regulation.

Our government contracts include government-sponsored managed care and administrative services contracts through the TRICARE program and certain other healthcare-related government contracts.

16

Table of Contents
Our state and federal contracts and the regulatory provisions applicable to us generally set forth the requirements for operating in the Medicaid and Medicare sectors, including provisions relating to:

•eligibility, enrollment and dis-enrollment processes;
•covered services;
•eligible providers;
•subcontractors;
•record-keeping and record retention;
•periodic financial and informational reporting;
•quality assurance;
•accreditation;
•health education and wellness and prevention programs;
•timeliness of claims payment;
•financial standards;
•safeguarding of member information;
•fraud, waste and abuse detection and reporting;
•grievance procedures; and
•organization and administrative systems.

A health plan or individual health insurance provider's compliance with these requirements is subject to monitoring by state regulators and by CMS. A health plan is also subject to periodic comprehensive quality assurance evaluations by a third-party reviewing organization and generally by the insurance department of the jurisdiction that licenses the health plan. A health plan or individual health insurance provider must also submit reports to various regulatory agencies, including quarterly and annual statutory financial statements and utilization reports.

Our health plans operate through individual state contracts, generally with an initial term of one to five years. The contracts often have renewal or extension terms or are renewable through the state's reprocurement process. The contracts generally are subject to termination for cause, an event of default or lack of funding, among other things.

Marketplace Contracts

We operate in 22 states under federally-facilitated marketplace contracts with CMS and state-based exchanges. Both contract types are renewable on an annual basis.

We operate under a contract with the Arkansas Department of Human Services Division of Medical Services and the Arkansas Insurance Department to participate in the Medicaid expansion model that Arkansas has adopted (referred to as "Arkansas Works").

Privacy Regulations

We are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and rules regarding the use, security and disclosure of protected health information, personal information, and other categories of confidential or legally protected data that our businesses handle. Such laws and rules include, without limitation, HIPAA, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU), and state privacy and security laws such as the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and the California Online Privacy Protection Act. Privacy and security laws and regulations often change due to new or amended legislation, regulations or administrative interpretation. A variety of state and federal regulators enforce these laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and other state regulators.

HIPAA is designed to improve the portability and continuity of health insurance coverage, simplify the administration of health insurance through standard transactions and ensure the privacy and security of individual health information. Among the requirements of HIPAA are the Administrative Simplification provisions which include: standards for processing health insurance claims and related transactions (Transactions Standards); requirements for protecting the privacy and limiting the use and disclosure of medical records and other personal health information (Privacy Rule); and standards and specifications for safeguarding personal health information which is maintained, stored or transmitted in electronic format (Security Rule). The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act amended certain provisions of HIPAA and enhanced data security obligations for covered entities and their business associates. HITECH also mandated individual notifications in instances of a data breach, provided enhanced penalties for HIPAA violations, and granted enforcement
17

Table of Contents
authority to states' Attorneys General in addition to the HHS Office for Civil Rights. The HIPAA Omnibus Rule further enhanced the changes under the HITECH Acts and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) which clarified that genetic information is protected under HIPAA and prohibits most health plans from using or disclosing genetic information for underwriting purposes. These regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non-compliance. The preemption provisions of HIPAA provide that the federal standards will not preempt state laws that are more stringent than the related federal requirements.

The Privacy and Security Rules and HITECH/Omnibus enhancements established requirements to protect the privacy of medical records and safeguard personal health information maintained and used by healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates.

The Security Rule requires healthcare providers, health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of health information electronically stored, maintained or transmitted. The HITECH Act and Omnibus Rule enhanced a federal requirement for notification when the security of protected health information is breached. In addition, there are state laws that have been adopted to provide for, among other things, private rights of action for breaches of data security and mandatory notification to persons whose identifiable information is obtained without authorization.

The requirements of the Transactions Standards apply to certain healthcare related transactions conducted using "electronic media." Since "electronic media" is defined broadly to include "transmissions that are physically moved from one location to another using portable data, magnetic tape, disk or compact disk media," many communications are considered to be electronically transmitted. Under HIPAA, health plans and providers are required to have the capacity to accept and send all covered transactions in a standardized electronic format. Penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with these requirements. The transaction standards were modified in October 2015 with the implementation of the ICD-10 coding system.

In addition, we process and maintain personal card data, particularly in connection with our Marketplace business. As a result, we must maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard, which is a multifaceted security standard intended to optimize the security of credit, debit and cash card transactions and protect cardholders against misuse of their personal information.

Other Fraud, Waste and Abuse Laws

Investigating and prosecuting healthcare fraud, waste and abuse continues to be a top priority for state and federal law enforcement entities. The focus of these efforts has been directed at Medicare, Medicaid, Health Insurance Marketplace and commercial products. The fraud, waste and abuse laws include the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Many states have false claim act statutes that closely resemble the federal False Claims Act. Additional fraud, waste and abuse prohibitions include a wide range of operating activities, such as kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products (such as prescription drugs) by a plan, billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider, improper marketing and violation of patient privacy rights. The laws and regulations relating to fraud, waste and abuse and the requirements applicable to health plans, PDPs and providers participating in these programs are complex and change regularly. Compliance with these laws may require substantial resources. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our fraud, waste and abuse detection methods. While we have both prospective and retrospective processes to identify abusive patterns and fraudulent billing, we continue to increase our capabilities to proactively detect inappropriate billing prior to payment.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

As the pace of change, complexity and uncertainty in the broader environment accelerates, we continue our strong investment in creating a purpose-driven culture and attracting, developing and retaining top talent. We seek out individuals with ambition for extraordinary impact and believe every employee is a leader and is critical to helping us transform the health of communities for those we serve. Our entrepreneurial spirited workforce is driven by a steadfast commitment to a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, is enabled through robust talent development programs, is supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and is optimized by full alignment with our purpose, values, and strategy through meaningful connections between our employees and their communities.

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 71,300 employees. During fiscal 2020, the number of employees increased by approximately 14,700 or 26%, primarily due to the acquisition of WellCare in 2020. During fiscal 2020, our voluntary turnover

rate was less than 10%, which is in line with the insurance industry standard benchmark, which is comprised of certain of our key competitors (AON Salary Increase and Turnover Study – Second Edition (September 2020)).

Diversity and Inclusion

We believe that a diverse workforce and inclusive environment enables competitive advantage and fuels improved service, innovation and performance with all stakeholders. We thoughtfully engage diverse talent across Centene, preparing women and underrepresented employees for leadership roles, and hiring diverse candidates who have a passion for serving our members and ambition for extraordinary impact.

We have a wide range of programs focused on early identification and accelerated development of diverse talent, including our Employee Inclusion Groups (EIGs), which help us further enhance our inclusive workforce culture. These voluntary, employee led groups support the attraction, development and retention of talent at all levels. EIGs provide professional and leadership opportunities, contribute to community engagement initiatives and support business innovation and corporate best practices. Because of their significant value to us, we support EIGs through leadership involvement, work time and space, resources and Executive Mentors. Today, there are over 10,000 participants across all five EIGs providing professional and leadership development opportunities for women, military veterans, individuals with disabilities, LGBTQ+ and multicultural employees. Each EIG offers mentorship programs aligned with our leadership model and bring in unique lived experiences in an effort to ensure we are meeting employees at their level to deliver the best outcomes for their development. EIGs also partake in networking events, training programs, fireside chats and panels addressing current issues and other development opportunities for their members.

Our team of talent advisors are responsible for leading the end-to-end search process, and leveraging our resources, tools and technologies to help our hiring leaders carefully consider the capabilities required to continue to propel our organization forward. Our talent advisors receive Advisory and Certified Diversity Recruiter training which are designed to ensure we consistently attract diverse pools of exceptional talent.

In 2021, we released our inaugural 2020 Diversity & Inclusion Annual Report, which may be reviewed for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Interested parties can find our 2020 Diversity & Inclusion Annual Report within the Investors section of our website, the URL of which is https://www.centene.com/who-we-are/corporate-facts-reports.html. Nothing on our website, including our Diversity and Inclusion Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.

Health, Safety and Well-Being

We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security when events arise that may require time away from work or that impact our employees' financial well-being; that support their physical, mental and well-being health; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.

In 2020, when COVID-19 presented an extraordinary threat to the health of our workforce, we responded quickly, equipping nearly 90% of our workforce to work from home within days of the declaration of the pandemic. We also enacted several new benefits, such as: ten days of additional emergency paid sick leave, a technology stipend, in office premium pay, and waived prior authorizations and cost sharing for COVID-19 related employee care. We further supported our workforce by providing assistance to those with school-aged children through a partnership with an online tutoring organization to provide deeply discounted one-on-one tutoring and group and after-school enrichment classes at no cost. We also created an employee resource site to provide well-being resources. Additionally, we established a highly trained, dedicated contact tracing concierge team to support employee’s well-being and provide easy access to HR professionals to respond to COVID-related questions.

In addition to workforce benefits and enhanced employee concierge services, we also enacted several new facility modifications and protocols to help ensure the safety of our employees. For instance, while most of our cubicles are already 6x6 feet or larger in dimension, we invested more than $20 million to retrofit with acrylic screens our cubicles, reception and security desks, as well as workstations for additional protection from the spread of respiratory droplets. These protective screens were installed for over 60,000 cubicles across the country. In large campuses, thermal scanning cameras were installed to identify elevated temperatures of all employees and visitors. To promote a healthy distance among colleagues, structured walking paths were created in the hallways of our offices, directional signage has been prepared to guide employees through walking paths, and common areas have been restricted.

In a recent COVID-19 survey focused on employee sentiment and our response to COVID-19, 89% of employees responded favorably (agreed or strongly agreed) to our approach across five key areas: leadership, communications, consistency, care for people, and COVID-19 situation.

Compensation and Benefits

Our compensation and benefits programs are market competitive and designed to attract and retain qualified employees. Our overall compensation philosophy is to pay for performance by linking the achievement of both Company and individual goals to total compensation. In addition to base pay, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, and a 401(k) plan.

Our benefits cover various aspects of an employee’s life to help them live healthy. These include medical, dental and vision insurance, short- and long-term disability, supplemental accidental death and dismemberment and life insurance, wellness program, flexible spending accounts, parental leave and caregiver leave.

We also offer benefits to help employees achieve optimum work-life balance. These include vacation, paid personal and sick time, paid company holidays, paid community volunteer time, an employee assistance program, tuition reimbursement/educational assistance, adoption reimbursement, on-site fitness centers or discount at local fitness centers.

Talent Development

Through our robust talent infrastructure, we continue working to deepen and prepare our talent bench and workforce, which is necessary to support our growth strategy. We believe every employee is a leader and is critical to our success in transforming communities. Our leadership model sets expectations for what it means to lead at Centene and through Centene University, we build skills for how to lead. Centene University is our personalized learning platform and is accessible to all employees, providing both instructor-led and self-directed learning that enables employees to develop their professional and business skills from anywhere and at any time. Our business-led flagship leadership development program, APEX, is a multi-day, instructor-led program, designed to expand mindsets and build capabilities to help our workforce thrive in the future. In 2020, we strengthened our commitment to talent development and activated APEX digital learnings for our full workforce. The asynchronous sessions focused on building skills to thrive in the evolving world of work, including: customer-centricity, digital dexterity, perseverance and resilience, and end-to-end problem solving. We also repositioned our front line leader program to a virtual, instructor-led program, connecting with approximately 5,000 people leaders.

In addition to building new workforce skills, we utilize our ongoing enterprise talent reviews, succession planning, career development planning and comprehensive HR analytics to provide insights to senior leaders to inform actions and drive intentional talent results through our People Plans, the integrated human capital component of our annual operating plans.

Organizational Culture – Meaningful Connections between Employees and the Communities We Serve

We, our health plans, and our subsidiaries have long been leaders in transforming the health of our members and the communities where they live. We believe in local partnerships and value the innovative programs and services that they provide for underserved and at-risk populations. We attract a workforce that is purpose-driven and passionate about transforming communities and we recognize the importance of volunteering and supporting the communities in which we serve. We support our workforce by providing paid time off benefits for employees to participate in individual and work-related community volunteer programs. Additionally, to support our communities during the pandemic, we established an additional emergency volunteer benefit, which provides medical and behavioral health professional employees with paid volunteer time off for up to 3 months.

With a largely remote workforce in 2020, we took additional steps to ensure a highly connected workforce, including new monthly forums for people leaders, new weekly communications for all employees, and new employee programming to engage in transparent dialogue on social issues.

More than 92% of our employees responded to the 2020 Shaping Centene Employee Engagement Survey and 88% of employees reported strong engagement, which surpassed the 75th percentile of Fortune 100 benchmark companies. Based on their responses, employees were strongly aligned with our strategy, with 96% understanding our mission and 92% understanding our objectives.

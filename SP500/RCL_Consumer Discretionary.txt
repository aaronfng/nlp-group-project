Item 1. Business.
General
We are a global cruise company. We control and operate four global cruise brands: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises (collectively, our "Global Brands"). We also own a 50% joint venture interest in TUI Cruises GmbH ("TUIC"), that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our "Partner Brands"). Together, our Global Brands and our Partner Brands operate a combined total of 61 ships in the cruise vacation industry with an aggregate capacity of approximately 137,930 berths as of December 31, 2020.
Our ships operate on a selection of worldwide itineraries that call on approximately 1,000 destinations on all seven continents. In addition to our headquarters in Miami, Florida, we have offices and a network of international representatives around the world, which primarily focus on sales and market development.
We compete principally by operating valued brands that offer exceptional service provided by our crew and on the basis of innovation and quality of ships, variety of itineraries, choice of destinations and price. We believe that our commitment to build state-of-the-art ships and to invest in the maintenance and upgrade of our fleet to, among other things, incorporate many of our latest signature innovations, allows us to continue to attract new and loyal repeat guests.
On January 19, 2021, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Azamara brand, including its three-ship fleet and associated intellectual property, to Sycamore Partners for $201 million. The transaction is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.
Royal Caribbean was founded in 1968 as a partnership. Its corporate structure has evolved over the years and, the current parent corporation, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., was incorporated on July 23, 1985 in the Republic of Liberia under the Business Corporation Act of Liberia.
COVID-19
The disruptions to our operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) have had, and continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The global efforts to contain the spread of the disease have resulted in travel restrictions and created significant uncertainty regarding worldwide port closures and availability. As part of the global containment effort, we implemented a voluntary suspension of our Global Brands' cruise operations beginning March 13, 2020, which has been extended through at least April 30, 2021, for most of our cruise operations. As of February 23, 2021, four of our ships were operating with guests onboard.
On and effective as of October 30, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") issued a Framework for Conditional Sailing Order (the “Conditional Order”) that will conditionally permit cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters under certain conditions and using a phased approach. The Conditional Order will remain in effect until the earlier of (1) the expiration of the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ declaration that COVID-19 constitutes a public health emergency, (2) the rescission or modification by the CDC Director of the Conditional Order based on specific public health or other considerations, or (3) November 1, 2021. See Business - Regulation for further details on the Conditional Order.
Our resumption of operations will include a staggered return of the fleet to service, which will include:
•Bringing the fleet from layup status to fully operational;
•Bringing crew back to an appropriate staffing level and expected reduced load factors for a period of time; and
•Implementing health and safety protocols on ships as they resume operations and while protocols are required.

We are working with both the CDC and the Healthy Sail Panel ("HSP"), formed in June 2020 by us and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. and composed of leading experts in relevant fields, including epidemiology, infectious diseases, public policy and regulation, engineering and general health safety, to prepare and develop our plan to meet the framework for the Conditional Order.
While the Conditional Order represents an important step in our return to service, many uncertainties remain as to the specifics, timing and costs of administering and implementing the requirements of the Conditional Order, some of which may be significant. Further, the Conditional Order contemplates that the CDC may issue additional requirements through technical instructions or orders as needed and that the phases described above will be further determined based on public health considerations, including the trajectory of the pandemic and the ability of cruise ship operators to successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of COVID-19. Based on our assessment of these conditions or for other reasons, we may determine it necessary to further extend our voluntary suspension of our Global Brands’ cruise sailings which currently extends through at least April 30, 2021, for most of our cruise operations.

We have undertaken several proactive measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19, including significant reduction of capital expenditures and operating expenses as well as the issuance of debt and shares of our common stock. Given the current environment, we intend to continue to prioritize and bolster liquidity through cash conservation and additional financing sources, which may include the issuance of new debt (including convertible debt), refinancing of existing debt, amortization deferrals under our export-credit backed debt facilities and issuance of common stock, to ensure that we are well positioned for recovery. Additionally, we agreed with certain of our lenders that we will not pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases until the end of the third quarter of 2022. See Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies and Recent Developments: COVID-19 and Note 1. General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 1. Financial Statements for further details on the impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition and results of operations.
Our Global Brands
Our Global Brands include Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara, and Silversea Cruises. We believe our Global Brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our Global Brands has its own marketing style, as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our Global Brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our Global Brands also offer similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. The itineraries of Global Brands are subject to resumption of our operations and local restrictions. In addition, our Global Brands have historically sourced passengers from similar markets around the world and operated in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, we strategically manage our Global Brands as a single business with the ultimate objective of maximizing long-term shareholder value.
Royal Caribbean International
Royal Caribbean International is positioned to compete in both the contemporary and premium segments of the cruise vacation industry. The brand appeals to families with children of all ages, as well as both older and younger couples, providing cruises that generally feature a casual ambiance, as well as a variety of activities and entertainment venues. We believe that the quality of the Royal Caribbean International brand allows it to achieve market coverage that is among the broadest of any of the major cruise brands in the cruise vacation industry. Royal Caribbean International’s strategy is to attract an array of vacationing guests by offering a wide variety of itineraries to destinations worldwide, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bahamas, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Panama Canal and New Zealand, with cruise lengths ranging from two to 24 nights. Royal Caribbean International offers multiple innovative options for onboard dining, entertainment and other onboard activities. Because of the brand’s ability to deliver extensive and innovative product offerings at an excellent value to consumers, we believe Royal Caribbean International is well positioned to attract new consumers to cruising and to continue to bring loyal repeat guests back for their next vacation.
Royal Caribbean International operates 24 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 84,200 berths. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, Royal Caribbean International has six ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 32,400 berths. These ships consist Odyssey of the Seas, which is expected to be delivered in early 2021, Wonder of the Seas and our sixth Oasis-class ship, which are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2022 and the second quarter of 2024, respectively, and the first three ships of a new generation, known as our Icon-class, which are expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2023, and the second quarters of 2025 and 2026, respectively.
The expected delivery dates for all of our ships on order are subject to change in the event of shipyard construction delays. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on the impact of COVID-19 on shipyard operations.
Celebrity Cruises
Celebrity Cruises is positioned within the luxury segment of the cruise vacation industry. Celebrity Cruises’ strategy is to target affluent consumers by delivering a destination-rich experience on upscale ships that offer, among other things, luxurious accommodations, refined design-forward spaces, world-class service and culinary excellence. Celebrity Cruises offers a range of itineraries to destinations, including Alaska, Asia, Australia, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, the Galapagos Islands, Hawaii, New Zealand, the Panama Canal and South America, with cruise lengths ranging from two to 18 nights.
Celebrity Cruises operates 14 ships with an aggregate capacity of approximately 29,220 berths, including the brand's newest ship Celebrity Apex, which was delivered in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we have two ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 6,500 berths. These ships consist of two Edge-class ships, including Celebrity Beyond and a fourth ship in the class, which are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2022 and in the fourth quarter of 2023, respectively. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l’Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship with capacity of approximately 3,250 berths, estimated for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of certain conditions precedent and financing.

Silversea Cruises
Silversea Cruise Holding Ltd. ("Silversea Cruises") is an ultra-luxury and expedition cruise line. On July 9, 2020, we acquired the remaining 33.3% interest in Silversea Cruises that we did not already own (the "noncontrolling interest") from Heritage Cruise Holding Ltd. ("Heritage"). As a result of the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest, Silversea Cruises is now a wholly owned cruise brand.
Silversea Cruises, formed in the early 1990s, is positioned as an ultra-luxury cruise line with smaller ships, high standards of accommodations, fine dining, personalized service and exotic itineraries. Silversea Cruises delivers distinctive destination experiences by visiting unique and remote destinations, including the Galapagos Islands, Antarctica and the Arctic with cruise itineraries generally ranging from six to 24 nights.
Silversea Cruises operates nine ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 3,350 berths, including the brand's newest ships Silver Origin and Silver Moon, which were delivered in the second and fourth quarters of 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Silversea Cruises has three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,750 berths. The ships are expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021, and in the first quarters of 2023 and 2024, respectively.
Azamara
On January 19, 2021, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Azamara brand, including its three-ship fleet with an aggregate capacity of approximately 2,100 berths and associated intellectual property, to Sycamore Partners for $201 million. The transaction is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021.
Our Partner Brands
Our Global Brands are complemented by our interest in TUIC, our 50%-owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises (collectively, our "Partner Brands").
TUIC is a joint venture owned 50% by us and 50% by TUI AG, a German tourism company, which is designed to serve the contemporary and premium segments of the German cruise market by offering products tailored for German guests. All onboard activities, services, shore excursions and menu offerings are designed to suit the preferences of this target market.
TUI Cruises operates seven ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 17,700 berths as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, TUI Cruises has three ships on order with an aggregate capacity of approximately 11,100 berths, that are expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2023, the third quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2026, respectively.
On June 30, 2020, TUIC acquired Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, a luxury and expedition brand for German-speaking guests, from TUI AG for approximately €1.2 billion, or $1.3 billion, as of the purchase date. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises operates two luxury liners and two smaller expedition ships, with an aggregate capacity of approximately 1,360 berths as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 1. General and Note 8. Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details.
Pullmantur
Pullmantur Holdings S.L ("Pullmantur Holdings") is a joint venture owned 49% by us and 51% by Cruises Investment Holdings S.A., an affiliate of Springwater Capital LLC. In 2020, Pullmantur Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under the terms of the Spanish insolvency laws due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the companies. Refer to Note 8. Other Assets to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information regarding Pullmantur's reorganization filing and its impact to the Company.
Industry
The cruising industry has been considered a well-established vacation sector in the North American, European and Australian markets and a developing sector in several other emerging markets. Although the industry is currently experiencing challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that cruising will continue to be a popular vacation choice in the long-term due to its inherent value, extensive itineraries and variety of shipboard and shoreside activities.

Table of Contents
As part of the global effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Company and other industry participants voluntarily suspended operations in March 2020, resulting in a limited number of cruises being taken in the past year. As a result, representative information of market penetration and other indicators are not available for 2020. For the five year period prior to 2020, industry data indicated that market penetration rates were still low and that a significant portion of cruise guests carried in those years were first-time cruisers. We believe this presents an opportunity for operational and financial recovery and long-term growth for the industry when it resumes operations.
The following table details industry market penetration rates for North America, Europe and Asia/Pacific for the five years prior to 2020 computed based on the number of annual cruise guests as a percentage of the total population:
Year (1)
North America(2)(3)
Europe(2)(4)
Asia/Pacific(2)(5)
2015		3.36%		1.25%		0.08%	2016		3.43%		1.23%		0.11%	2017		3.56%		1.28%		0.15%	2018		3.87%		1.38%		0.16%	2019		3.89%		1.41%		0.20%

(1)Historically, we have reported annual comparable information for relevant comparisons to other periods. The 2020 suspension of global cruise operations as a result of COVID-19 does not allow for a meaningful comparison to prior years' information and as such the 2020 data has been excluded from this table.
(2)Source: Our estimates are based on a combination of data obtained from publicly available sources including the International Monetary Fund, United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Cruise Lines International Association ("CLIA") and G.P. Wild. In addition, our estimates incorporate our own analysis utilizing the same publicly available cruise industry data as a base.

The global cruise fleet was served by a weighted average of approximately 579,000 berths during 2019 with approximately 354 ships at the end of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 67 ships with an estimated 159,000 berths that were expected to be placed in service in the global cruise market through 2024, not taking into account ships taken out of service or ordered during these periods. We believe that, starting in 2020, cruise ships in the industry were taken out of service at an accelerated rate and new ship orders were deferred due to global cruise operation restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The global cruise industry carried approximately 30.0 million cruise guests in 2019 and approximately 28.5 million in 2018.
The following table details the growth in global weighted average berths and the global, North American, European and Asia/Pacific cruise guests for the five years prior to the impact of COVID-19 in 2020 (in thousands, except berth data):

North America
Industry cruise guests have been primarily sourced from North America, which represented approximately 47% of global cruise guests in 2019. The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 4% from 2015 to 2019.
Europe
Industry cruise guests sourced from Europe represented approximately 25% of global cruise guests in 2019. The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 3% from 2015 to 2019.
Asia/Pacific
Industry cruise guests sourced from the Asia/Pacific region represented approximately 24% of global cruise guests in 2019. The compound annual growth rate in cruise guests sourced from this market was approximately 24% from 2015 to 2019.
Competition
We compete with a number of cruise lines. Our principal competitors are Carnival Corporation & plc, which owns, among other brands, Aida Cruises, Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, Cunard Line, Holland America Line, P&O Cruises, Princess Cruises and Seabourn; Disney Cruise Line; MSC Cruises; and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd, which owns Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. Cruise lines also compete with other vacation alternatives such as land-based resort hotels, internet-based alternative lodging sites and sightseeing destinations for consumers’ leisure time. The COVID-19 pandemic, related restrictions and general economic conditions have significantly affected companies within the vacation market which may result in a changed competitive landscape by the time we return to service.
Operating Focus
Our principal operating strategies remain consistent with our historical strategies, yet have been affected by the vast impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, on our Company's operations. While our cruise operations remain suspended, we have and will continue to prioritize those operating strategies that reduce our capital and operating expenditures, enhance our liquidity and support the healthy and safe return to cruising globally for guests, crew and the communities visited, including for some time after we resume cruise operations.
Our Company's operating focus is as follows:
•protect the health, safety and security of our guests and employees,
•support the healthy return of cruising globally along with our industry partners, including national and local governments and regulators, the communities in which we operate, other cruise companies, shipyards, our guests and trade partners,
•focus on cost control and efficiency, ensure adequate cash and liquidity, manage our capital expenditures and our balance sheet, with the overall goals of sustaining our operations and being well positioned for recovery, and, in the long-term, maximizing our return on invested capital and shareholder value,
•protect the environment in which our vessels and organization operate,

Table of Contents
•invest in our workforce in order to better serve our global guest base and grow our business, and promote gender equality, diversity and inclusion,
•strengthen our consumer engagement in order to enhance our revenues,
•increase the awareness and market penetration of our brands globally,
•strategically invest in our fleet through the upgrade and maintenance of existing ships and the transfer of key innovations, while prudently expanding our fleet with new state-of-the-art cruise ships,
•capitalize on the portability and flexibility of our ships by deploying them into those markets and itineraries that provide opportunities to optimize returns, while continuing our focus on existing key markets,
•provide extraordinary destination experiences and state-of-the-art port facilities to our guests,
•continue to integrate digital technological capabilities, data analytics and artificial intelligence into our operations to service customer preferences and expectations in an innovative manner, create efficiencies and enhance employee satisfaction, and
•maintain strong relationships with travel agencies, which continue to be the principal industry distribution channel, while enhancing our consumer outreach programs.
Safety and health policies
We are committed to protecting the health, safety and security of our guests, employees and others working on our behalf. Our efforts in these areas are managed by our dedicated Safety, Security, Environment, Medical and Public Health Department which is responsible for all of our maritime safety, global security, environmental stewardship and medical/public health activities; overseen by the Safety, Environment and Health Committee of our board of directors and informed by a Maritime Advisory Board of experts.
Support the healthy return of cruising
We continue to work and collaborate with the Healthy Sail Panel, epidemiological and policy experts, health authorities and various governments around the globe to ensure a healthy and safe return to cruising for guests, crew and the communities visited. We work in close partnership and communication with our contracted shipyards to carefully address our newbuild delivery delays and work towards a safe and effective shipyard working environment in the midst of COVID-19. We have established flexible cruise pricing and booking programs (e.g. Cruise with Confidence, Best Price Guarantee and all-inclusive pricing) that present our guests with options and value as we anticipate our return to service. The travel agency community has been a vital partner in our success, and we are committed to assist the industry during this challenging time with essential financial relief (e.g., the RCL CARES program).
Focus on cost control and efficiency, capital expenditure reductions, adequate cash and liquidity and managing of our balance sheet
We have taken significant actions to reduce operating and capital expenses during the suspension of our global cruise operations. Given the current environment, we continue to prioritize and bolster liquidity through cash conservation and additional financing sources while managing our balance sheet to ensure that we are well positioned for recovery. We are focused on leveraging our scale and shifting our resources behind our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Silversea brands. Additionally, we agreed with certain of our lenders that we will not pay dividends or engage in stock repurchases until the end of the third quarter of 2022.
We are focused on maintaining a strong liquidity position, a balanced debt maturity profile, and returning to investment grade credit metrics. We believe these strategies enhance our ability to achieve our overall goal of maximizing our long-term shareholder value.
Protect the environment
We are focused on the environmental health of the marine environment and communities in which we operate. This includes reducing our carbon footprint through the energy and carbon efficiencies included in the design of our new capacity, our ongoing energy management program on our existing fleet and the development of new technologies.
Our long-term partnership with the World Wildlife Fund focuses on greenhouse gas reduction strategies, sustainable food supplies, sustainable destinations and guest education on ocean conservation issues, including climate change, which supports onboard conservation efforts such as our reduced use of plastics and increased sourcing of sustainable seafood. We are also committed to water quality and management projects onboard and in the communities in which we operate.

We believe in transparent reporting on our environmental and sustainability stewardship, as well as our corporate governance efforts, and annually publish a Sustainability Report. This report, which is accessible on our corporate website, highlights our progress with regards to those environmental and social aspects of our business that we believe are most significant to our organization and stakeholders. In addition to providing an overview, the report complies with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative to ensure the report is as complete and accurate as possible. Our corporate website also provides information about our environmental performance goals and sustainability initiatives. The foregoing information contained on our website is not part of any of these reports and is not incorporated by reference herein or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Investing in our workforce and promoting gender equality, diversity and inclusion
We believe that our employees, both shipboard and shoreside, are a critical success factor for our business. We strive to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain the best employees, who provide our guests with extraordinary vacations. Our ability to attract, engage, and retain key employees has been and will remain critical to our success.
We focus on providing our employees with a competitive compensation structure, development opportunities, and other personal and professional growth opportunities in order to strengthen and support our human capital. We also select, develop and have strategies to retain high performing leaders to advance the enterprise now and in the future. To that end, we pay special attention to identifying high performing potential leaders and developing bench strength so these leaders can assume leadership roles throughout the organization.
We strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces collaboration, motivation and innovation, and believe that maintaining a strong employee-focused culture is beneficial to the growth and expansion of our business. We support the equal representation of women in all levels. We foster diversity and inclusion among our broad employee base. Refer to the Human Capital section below for further information.
Consumer engagement
We place a strong focus on identifying the needs of our guests and creating product features and innovations that our customers value. We are focused on targeting high-value guests by better understanding consumer data and insights to create communication strategies that resonate with our target audiences.
We target customers across all touch points and identify underlying needs for which guests are willing to pay a premium. We rely on various programs and technologies during the cruise-planning, cruising and after-cruise periods aimed at increasing ticket prices, onboard revenues and occupancy. We have and expect to strategically invest in onboard projects on our ships that we believe drive marketability, profitability and improve the guest experience.
Global awareness and market penetration
We increase brand awareness and market penetration of our cruise brands in various ways, including the use of communication strategies and marketing campaigns designed to emphasize the qualities of each brand and to broaden the awareness of the brand, especially among target groups. Our marketing strategies include the use of travel agencies, traditional media, mobile and digital media as well as social media, influencers and brand websites. Our brands engage past and potential guests by collaborating with travel partners and through call centers, international offices and international representatives. In addition, our Global Brands target repeat guests with exclusive benefits offered through their respective loyalty programs.
We sell and market our Global Brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises, to guests outside of the United States and Canada through the combined efforts of internationally focused internal resources and a network of independent international representatives located throughout the world. Historically, our focus has been to primarily source guests for our Global Brands from North America. We will continue to expand our focus on selling and marketing our cruise brands to guests in countries outside of North America by tailoring itineraries and onboard product offerings to the cultural characteristics and preferences of our international guests. In addition, we explore opportunities that may arise to acquire or develop brands tailored to specific markets.
Passenger ticket revenues generated by sales originating in countries outside of the United States were approximately 35% of total passenger ticket revenues in 2019, and 39% in 2018. International guests have grown from approximately 2.5 million in 2015 to approximately 2.6 million in 2019. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - “Conducting business globally may result in increased costs and other risks” for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations.
Fleet upgrade and maintenance
We place a strong focus on innovation, which we seek to achieve by introducing new concepts on our new ships and continuously making improvements to our fleet through modernization projects and key technological improvements. Several of these innovations have become signature elements of our brands. For the Royal Caribbean International brand,

Table of Contents
we introduced the “Royal Promenade” (a boulevard with shopping, dining and entertainment venues) and interior balconies on the Oasis class ships and a two-level family suite on Symphony of the Seas. For the Celebrity Cruises brand, we enhanced many of the brand's design features through the introduction of the Solstice class ships. More recently, with the introduction of Celebrity Edge, we introduced the "Magic Carpet" (a cantilevered, floating platform that reaches a height of 13 stories above sea level and can serve as a dining venue, full bar and platform for live music) and newly designed staterooms with an "Infinite Veranda" where, with the touch of a button, the veranda becomes part of the entire living space.
As part of the newbuild and modernization programs, we also seek to bring innovations in the areas of safety, reliability and energy efficiency to our fleet.
We are committed to building state-of-the-art ships at a moderate growth rate and we believe our success in this area provides us with a competitive advantage. Our newer vessels traditionally generate higher revenue yield premiums and are more efficient to operate than older vessels.
As of December 31, 2020, our Global Brands and Partner Brands have 15 ships on order. Refer to the Operations section below for further information on our ships on order. In addition, we regularly evaluate opportunities to order new ships, purchase existing ships or sell ships in our current fleet while ensuring that we remain focused on the returns we generate on invested capital and maintaining a high level of discipline on capital spending and operating leverage.
We have undertaken measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19, such as the reduction of our capital expenditures by delaying or deferring newbuild deliveries and the modernization of our ships. The expected capital expenditures for 2021 are $2.1 billion and are mostly related to newbuild projects which have committed financing. During 2021, the Company expects the delivery of Odyssey of the Seas and Silver Dawn during the first and fourth quarter, respectively. In 2022, the Company has two ship deliveries scheduled, both with committed financing: Wonder of the Seas and Celebrity Beyond. Excluding the newbuilds, the capital expenditures for 2022 will depend on the Company’s schedule to return to operation. Moreover, COVID-19 has impacted shipyard operations which has resulted in delivery delays for newbuilds. The exact duration of the ship delivery delays is currently under discussion with the impacted shipyards.
During 2020, we disposed of Celebrity Xperience, Majesty of the Seas and Empress of the Seas. Additionally, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Azamara brand which includes three vessels: Azamara Journey, Azamara Quest and Azamara Pursuit. These six ships represent approximately 5.2% of our 2019 capacity. During 2020, we also disposed of the following ships which were previously chartered to Pullmantur: Zenith, Monarch, Horizon, Sovereign.
Markets and itineraries
In an effort to penetrate untapped markets, diversify our consumer base and respond to changing economic and geopolitical market conditions, we continue to seek opportunities to deploy ships to new and stronger markets and itineraries throughout the world. The portability of our ships allows us to deploy our ships to meet demand within our existing cruise markets. We make deployment decisions generally 18 to 28 months in advance, with the goal of optimizing the overall profitability of our portfolio. Additionally, the infrastructure investments we have made to create a flexible global sourcing model have made our brands relevant in a number of markets around the world, which allows us to be opportunistic and source the highest yielding guests for our itineraries.
Our ships offer a wide selection of itineraries that call on more than 1,000 destinations in 126 countries, spanning all seven continents. We are focused on obtaining the best possible long-term shareholder returns by operating in established markets while growing our presence in developing markets. New capacity has allowed us to expand into new markets and itineraries. Our brands have expanded their mix of itineraries while strengthening our ability to further penetrate the Asian and Australian markets. The acquisition of Silversea Cruises added more than 500 new destinations allowing us to expand and enhance our selection of exotic itineraries.
As we plan for our brands' return to service, we are developing new and attractive itineraries that will allow us to resume our operations on a staggered basis. We are also responding quickly to changes in market demand, as observed in our new bookings.
Destination experiences and port facilities
Additionally, in order to provide unique destination experiences to our guests, we have invested in our private land destinations. For instance, in 2018, we announced Perfect Day Island Collection, an initiative to develop a series of private island destinations around the world. The first island in the collection, Perfect Day at CocoCay, opened in Spring 2019 and includes a wide range of attractions, such as a water park, zip line and wave and freshwater pool. As a result of the operational disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to bolster our liquidity, we have delayed previously announced Perfect Day site openings and are reassessing their timing as well as the timing of our complementary Royal Beach Club offering portfolio. We are also reassessing our investment in other destinations.

In an effort to secure desirable berthing facilities for our ships, and to provide new or enhanced cruise destinations for our guests, we have actively assisted or invested in the development or enhancement of certain port facilities and infrastructure, including mixed-use commercial properties, located in strategic ports of call. For instance, a new homeport cruise terminal of approximately 170,000 square feet was completed at PortMiami in Miami, Florida in 2018. We have delayed the expected completion of our new homeport cruise terminal in Galveston, Texas until 2022.
Generally, we collaborate with local, private or governmental entities by providing management and/or financial assistance and often enter into long-term port usage arrangements. Our participation in these efforts is generally accomplished via investments with the relevant government authority and/or various other strategic partnerships established to develop and/or operate the port facilities, by providing direct development and management expertise or in certain limited circumstances, by providing direct or indirect financial support. In exchange for our involvement, we generally secure preferential berthing rights for our ships.
Technological capabilities
Technology is a pervasive part of virtually every business process we use to support our strategic focus and provide a quality experience to our customers before, during and after their cruise. Technology also plays a critical role in the measures and protocols that we have developed and will continue to develop to mitigate COVID-19 on our cruise ships. For example, through the deployment of our innovative electronic safety drill ("Muster 2.0") program, we have added convenience, allowed for physical distancing, and improved our guests experience regarding the mandatory safety briefing. Additionally, through the in-app messaging technology we are enhancing guest check-in to support education, testing and screening information prior to embarkation, and to support onboard detection contingency scenarios and protocols, and most importantly promote the health and safety of guests and crew.
In past years, we have continued to integrate digital capabilities into our operations and have increased our focus in bringing in data analytics and artificial intelligence into our processes. For example, we have continued the deployment of our innovative guest journey solutions across our fleet from online check-in to port embarkation to onboard cruise experience. At the same time, we are investing in shipboard operational technology to facilitate casino play, hotel maintenance, as well as the optimization of marine maintenance. In concert with our destination focus, our island technology solutions are now enabling our guests to remain connected with WiFi access, order food and beverage as well as take advantage of all the island based activities with the same ease as onboard our ships.
Investments in our core platforms, as well as the trade and direct distribution channels, are delivering the benefit of more modernized solutions with scalability and faster self-service response times while also deploying new features such as flight packages and additional promotional offer capabilities.
Cyber security and data privacy are an ongoing focus, and we have made and will continue to make investments to protect our customer data, intellectual property and global operations.
Travel agency support and consumer outreach
Travel agencies continue to be the primary source of ticket sales for our ships. We believe in the value of this distribution channel and invest in maintaining strong relationships with our travel partners. To accomplish this goal, we seek to ensure that our commission rates and incentive structures remain competitive with the marketplace. We continuously work with travel agencies to sell upgrades and add-ons such as air and pre-cruise purchases to improve the retention and profitability of the channel. We provide brand dedicated sales representatives who serve as consultants to our travel partners. We also provide trained customer service representatives, call centers and online training tools.
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we launched the RCL CARES program which provided dedicated financial guidance as travel advisors navigated government relief benefits, including small business loans and the Paycheck Protection Program. During December 2020, we announced the Pay it Forward program which made available $40 million in the form of interest free commercial loans for qualifying travel agencies to begin their recovery efforts. Our Pay it Forward program launched in February 2021.
In addition, we continue to operate our Consumer Outreach department, which provides consumers 24-hour access to our vacation planners and customer service agents in our call centers. In addition, we maintain and invest in our websites, including mobile applications and mobile websites. We enable our guests to communicate and book with us through various channels such as phone, web, chat, text message, and/or email.
We also have an Onboard Cruise Sales department to help guests to book their next cruise vacations while onboard our ships.
Guest Services
We offer to handle virtually all travel aspects related to guest reservations and transportation, including arranging

Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises offer recognition and status upgrades to their guests through their loyalty programs, Crown & Anchor Society, Captain’s Club, Le Club Voyage and Venetian Society, respectively, to encourage repeat business. Crown & Anchor Society has approximately 17.0 million members worldwide. Captain’s Club, Le Club Voyage and Venetian Society have approximately 5.2 million members combined worldwide. Members are recognized through increasing membership status by accumulating cruise points or credits, depending on the brand, which may be redeemed on future sailings. Members are awarded points or credits in proportion to the number of cruise days and stateroom category. The loyalty programs provide tiers of membership benefits which entitle guests to upgraded experiences and recognition relative to the status achieved once the guests have accumulated the number of cruise points or credits specified for each tier. In addition, upon achieving a certain level of cruise points or credits, members benefit from reciprocal membership benefits across all of our loyalty programs. Examples of the benefits available under our loyalty programs include, but are not limited to, priority ship embarkation, priority waitlist for shore excursions, complimentary laundry service, complimentary Internet, booklets with onboard discount offers, upgraded bathroom amenities, private seating on the pool deck, ship tours and, in the case of our most loyal guests who have achieved the highest levels of cruise points or credits, complimentary cruise days. We regularly work to enhance each of our loyalty programs by adding new features and amenities in order to reward our repeat guests.

(1)The revenue impact from Silversea Cruises' new ships will be recognized on a three month reporting lag from when the ships enter service. Refer to Note 1. General to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.
In addition, as of December 31, 2020, we have an agreement in place with Chantiers de l’Atlantique to build an additional Edge-class ship for delivery in 2025, which is contingent upon completion of conditions precedent and financing.
Seasonality
Our revenues have historically been seasonal based on the demand for cruises. Demand is typically strongest for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere’s summer months and holidays. In order to mitigate the impact of the winter weather in the Northern Hemisphere and to capitalize on the summer season in the Southern Hemisphere, our brands have focused on deployment in the Caribbean, Asia and Australia during that period.
Passengers and Capacity
Selected statistical information is shown in the following table (see Financial Presentation- Description of Certain Line Items and Selected Operational and Financial Metrics under Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for definitions). Passengers Carried, Passenger Cruise Days, Available Passenger Cruise Days and Occupancy reflect the impact of our 2020 suspension of operations due to the COVID-19

Refer to Note 1. General and Note 11. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the three-month reporting lag and the Silversea Cruises acquisition.
(2)    We acquired a controlling interest in Silversea Cruises on July 31, 2018 and report their results on a three-month reporting lag. As a result, these amounts include only August and September 2018 amounts for Silversea Cruises. Refer to Note 1. General and Note 11. Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the three-month reporting lag and the Silversea Cruises acquisition.
(3)    These amounts do not include November and December 2015 amounts for Pullmantur as the net Pullmantur result for those months was included within Other expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the elimination of the Pullmantur two-month reporting lag, and did not affect Gross Yields, Net Yields, Gross Cruise Costs, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs Excluding Fuel. Additionally, effective August 2016, following the sale of our 51% interest in Pullmantur Holdings, we no longer include Pullmantur in these amounts.
Cruise Pricing
Our cruise ticket prices include accommodations and a wide variety of activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. Prices vary depending on many factors including the destination, cruise length, stateroom category selected and the time of year the cruise takes place. Soon after our initial suspension of operations due to the occurrence of COVID-19, we established flexible cruise pricing programs (i.e. Cruise with Confidence, Best Price Guarantee and all-inclusive pricing) that present our guests with options and value as we anticipate our return to service.
Although we grant credit terms in select markets mainly outside of the United States, our payment terms generally require an upfront deposit to confirm a reservation, with the balance due prior to the sailing. Our cruises are generally available for sale at least one year in advance and often more than two years in advance of sailing. During the selling period of a cruise, we continually monitor and adjust our cruise ticket prices for available guest staterooms based on demand, with the objective of maximizing net yields.
As our business has grown globally, our sale arrangements with travel agents may vary. For instance, although our direct business has historically grown at a rapid pace, sale arrangements through travel agent charter and group sales are proportionately higher in the China market than in our other markets which are primarily through retail agency and direct sales.
We have developed and implemented enhancements to our reservations system that provide us and our travel partners with additional capabilities, making it easier to do business with us. For example, we offer air transportation to our guests through our air transportation program available in major cities around the world.
Passenger ticket revenues accounted for approximately 68% of total revenues in 2020, and 72% of total revenues in 2019 and 2018.
Onboard Activities and Other Revenues
Our cruise brands offer modern fleets with a wide array of onboard services, amenities and activities which vary by brand and ship. While many onboard activities are included in the base price of a cruise, we realize additional revenues from, among other things, gaming, the sale of alcoholic and other beverages, Internet and other telecommunication services, gift shop items, shore excursions, photography, spa/salon and fitness services, art auctions, retail shops and a wide variety of specialty restaurants and dining options. Many of these services are available for pre-booking prior to embarkation. These activities are offered either directly by us or by independent concessionaires from which we receive a percentage of their revenues. The all-inclusive pricing programs that we offer currently, add some of these onboard activity and other services to the base price of the cruise.

In conjunction with our cruise vacations, we offer pre- and post-cruise hotel packages to our Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises guests. We also offer cruise vacation protection coverage to guests in a number of markets, which provides guests with coverage for trip cancellation, medical protection and baggage protection. Onboard and other revenues accounted for approximately 32% of total revenues in 2020, and 28% of total revenues in 2019 and 2018.
Segment Reporting
We control and operate four cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara, and Silversea Cruises. In addition, we have a 50% joint venture interest in TUIC, our 50%-owned joint venture that operates the German brands TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises. We believe our brands possess the versatility to enter multiple cruise market segments within the cruise vacation industry. Although each of our brands has its own marketing style as well as ships and crews of various sizes, the nature of the products sold and services delivered by our brands share a common base (i.e., the sale and provision of cruise vacations). Our brands also have similar itineraries as well as similar cost and revenue components. In addition, our brands source passengers from similar markets around the world and operate in similar economic environments with a significant degree of commercial overlap. As a result, our brands have been aggregated as a single reportable segment based on the similarity of their economic characteristics, types of consumers, regulatory environment, maintenance requirements, supporting systems and processes as well as products and services provided. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker and all significant operating decisions including the allocation of resources are based upon the analyses of the Company as one segment. (For financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.)
Human Capital
Our human capital strategies are continually evolving to provide a rewarding and fulfilling employee experience. Some key elements of these strategies include: a diverse and inclusive workforce; opportunities for employee growth and development; support for health and well-being; and an active listening strategy to make sure voices are heard in order to facilitate continuous improvement.
As of December 31, 2020, our four global cruise brands, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara, and Silversea Cruises, employed approximately 85,000 employees. Our shoreside workforce, including employees who work at our private destinations, consisted of approximately 6,900 full time and 100 part-time employees. Our shipboard workforce consisted of 78,000 employees, and as of December 31, 2020, approximately 89% of our shipboard employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Due to the pause in our cruise operations in 2020, we repatriated the majority of our shipboard employees to their home countries, and as a result, we ended the year with approximately 87% less employees onboard our ships compared with 2019.
The following table details the distribution of our workforce by employee type and region as of December 31, 2020:

Employee Type(1)
U.S. Based Employees	International Employees	Shoreside Operations	4,000	2,000	Shipboard Employees	 	78,000	
Private Destinations(2)
 	1,000 

(1)    Includes full time and part time employees.
(2)    Private Destinations includes Coco Cay, Labadee and Galapagos based employees.

As a global operation, we take great pride in the broad diversity of our workforce and the value that it brings to our company. Our shoreside workforce is gender diverse with 53% female representation. Our shipboard workforce is comprised of employees from 120 plus countries. The majority of our shipboard workforce comes from the Philippines (29%), Indonesia (16%) and India (14%). Our shoreside workforce is primarily based out of the U.S. (69%), Philippines (10%), U.K. (5%) and China (4%).

In addition, we offer a variety of learning and development programs to our workforce which includes a combination of instructor led (classroom and virtual) and web based (self-learning) courses. In 2020, our workforce spent approximately 1 million hours in training across a variety of areas ranging from Ethics, Compliance, Data Analysis, Business Software and Tools, Finance/Accounting, Professional Development, Project Management Skills, Leadership and Safety/Security. In total, our workforce completed over 560,000 courses within our learning management systems.
The Company has created a 24/7 care platform provided at no-cost that allows for employees and their families to get confidential assistance with stress management, relationships, financial concerns or legal concerns. Through this assistance program, we offer:
•Short-term Professional Counseling - providing support for personal and emotional issues through telephone, video or in-person sessions.
•Family Support Services - connecting our employees with advisors that can provide them resources to assist with family planning, parenting, childcare, eldercare, home care support and more.
•Legal Support Services - providing general guidance and referrals to professionals to answer legal questions surrounding divorce, custody, adoption, real estate, debt, bankruptcy, landlord/tenant issues, and more.
•Financial Support Services - providing general guidance and referrals to professionals to answer financial questions about budgeting, debt management, tax issues, and more.
•LifeWorks Digital Wellbeing Website - granting access to an online platform containing hundreds of articles, resources, webinars and tools to help employees better manage overall well-being.
Further, our Disaster Relief program provides emergency funding to employees who have been directly impacted by natural disasters. All shipboard and shoreside employees are eligible for assistance from this fund.
Finally, COVID-19 has had and continues to have a tremendous impact on our business. During 2020, our offices closed and our crew were repatriated off our ships to their home countries. In response, we ramped up our listening strategy through frequent pulse surveys to understand our employees' needs and concerns and help them navigate the crisis. We continue to run our pulse surveys every quarter to understand and positively impact our employees’ experience. In 2020, our shoreside employee engagement scores remained high and were higher than the prior 3-year average.
Insurance
We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, with insured values generally equal to the net book value of each ship. This coverage is maintained with reputable insurance underwriters from the British, Scandinavian, French, United States and other reputable international insurance markets.

17
Table of Contents
We are members of four Protection and Indemnity ("P&I") clubs, which are part of a worldwide group of 13 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the “IG”). Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&I clubs, subject to the clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage determined by the IG. P&I coverage provided by the clubs is on a mutual basis and we are subject to additional premium calls in the event of a catastrophic loss incurred by any member of the 13 P&I clubs, whereby the reinsurance limits purchased by the IG are exhausted. We are also subject to additional premium calls based on investment and underwriting shortfalls experienced by our own individual insurers.
We maintain war risk insurance for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as for loss or damage to our vessels arising from acts of war, including invasion, insurrection, terrorism, rebellion, piracy and hijacking. Our primary war risk coverage is provided by a Norwegian war risk insurance association and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our four P&I clubs. Consistent with most marine war risk policies, our coverage is subject to cancellation in the event of a change in risk. In the event of a war between major powers, our primary policies terminate after thirty days’ notice and our excess policies terminate immediately. Our excess policies are also subject to cancellation after a notice period of seven days in the event of other changes in risk. These notice periods allow for premiums to be renegotiated based on changes in risk.
Insurance coverage for other exposures, such as shoreside property and casualty, passenger off-vessel, directors and officers and network security and privacy, are maintained with various global insurance companies.
We do not carry business interruption insurance for our ships based on our evaluation of the risks involved and protective measures already in place, as compared to the cost of insurance.
All insurance coverage is subject to certain limitations, exclusions and deductible levels. In addition, in certain circumstances, we either self-insure or co-insure a portion of these risks. Premiums charged by insurance carriers, including carriers in the maritime insurance industry, increase or decrease from time to time and tend to be cyclical in nature. These cycles are impacted both by our own loss experience and by losses incurred in direct and reinsurance markets. We historically have been able to obtain insurance coverage in amounts and at premiums we have deemed to be commercially acceptable. No assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will be available to us in the future, particularly for war risk insurance.
Trademarks
We own a number of registered trademarks related to the Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, Azamara and Silversea Cruises cruise brands. The registered trademarks include the name “Royal Caribbean International” and its crown and anchor logo, the name “Celebrity Cruises” and its “X” logo, the name “Azamara” and its "open world" and "star logo", the name “Silversea Cruises” and its logo, and the names of various cruise ships, ship venues and other marketing programs. We believe our largest brands' trademarks are widely recognized throughout the world and have considerable value. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
Regulation
Our ships are regulated by various international, national, state and local laws, regulations and treaties in force in the jurisdictions in which they operate. In addition, our ships are registered in the Bahamas, Malta or in the case of our ships operating in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador. Each ship is subject to regulations issued by its country of registry, including regulations issued pursuant to international treaties governing the safety of our ships, guests and crew as well as environmental protection. Each country of registry conducts periodic inspections to verify compliance with these regulations as discussed more fully below. Ships operating out of ports of call around the world are also subject to inspection by the maritime authorities of that country for compliance with international treaties and local regulations. Additionally, ships operating out of the United States ports are subject to inspection by the United States Coast Guard for compliance with international treaties and by the United States Public Health Service for sanitary and health conditions. Our ships are also subject to similar inspections pursuant to the laws and regulations of various other countries our ships visit.
We believe that we are in material compliance with all the regulations applicable to our ships and that we have all licenses necessary to conduct our business. Health, safety, security, environmental and financial responsibility issues are, and we believe will continue to be, an area of focus by the relevant government authorities in the United States and internationally. From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes may be proposed that could impact our operations and subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future.

CDC Framework for Conditional Sailing Order
On and effective as of October 30, 2020, the CDC issued a Framework for Conditional Sailing Order (the “Conditional Order”) that will conditionally permit cruise ship passenger operations in U.S. waters under certain conditions and using a phased approach. The Conditional Order will remain in effect until the earlier of (1) the expiration of the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ declaration that COVID-19 constitutes a public health emergency, (2) the rescission or modification by the CDC Director of the Conditional Order based on specific public health or other considerations, or (3) November 1, 2021.
All phases listed below are outlined in the Conditional Order; however, only the first phase listed is detailed in the Conditional Order. The remaining phases are currently pending approval by the CDC for distribution to all cruise lines prior to being detailed in the CDC's Phase 2 Technical Instructions.
•Establishment of laboratory testing of crew and guests onboard cruise ships in U.S. waters and upon embarkation and disembarkation;
•Simulated voyages designed to test a cruise ship operators’ ability to mitigate COVID-19 on cruise ships;
•Meeting and maintaining requirements for a Conditional Sailing Certificate, which include, among other things, implementing the required testing protocols, a prohibition on offering itineraries longer than seven days, and the demonstration at each port where a ship intends to dock of approval with U.S. port and local health authorities, which requires medical care agreements addressing evacuation to onshore hospitals, housing agreements with onshore facilities for isolation and quarantine of COVID-19 cases, and port agreements to limit the number of cruise ships at any single port; and
•A return to passenger voyages in a manner that mitigates the risk of COVID-19 introduction, transmission, or spread among passengers and crew onboard ships and ashore to communities.
We are working with both the CDC and the HSP, to implement the requirements of the Conditional Order and establish a comprehensive set of health and safety measures at every step of the guest journey with rigorous protocols. We are also designing itineraries where we will be able to control the vacation experience in compliance with the health and safety protocols contained in the Conditional Order.
While the Conditional Order represents an important step in our return to service, many uncertainties remain as to the specifics, timing and costs of administering and implementing the requirements of the Conditional Order, some of which may be material to our results of operations. Further, the Conditional Order contemplates that the CDC may issue additional requirements through technical instructions or orders as needed and that the phases described above will be further determined based on public health considerations, including the trajectory of the pandemic and the ability of cruise ships operators to successfully employ measures that mitigate the risk of COVID-19.
Our resumption of operations will include a staggered return of the fleet to service which will include:
•Bringing the fleet from layup status to fully operational;
•Bringing crew back to an appropriate staffing level and expected reduced load factors for a period of time; and
•Implementation of the health and safety protocols on ships as they resume operations.
We are also reviewing and assessing the uncertainties relating to the Conditional Order’s requirements. Based on our assessment of these conditions or for other reasons, we may determine it necessary to further extend our voluntary suspension of our Global Brands’ cruise sailings.
Safety and Security Regulations
Our ships are required to comply with international safety standards defined in the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”), which, among other things, establishes requirements for ship design, structural features, materials, construction, lifesaving equipment and safe management and operation of ships to ensure guest and crew safety. The SOLAS standards are revised from time to time and incorporated in our ship design and operation, as applicable. The latest enhancements include the addition of the Polar Code which sets goal-based standards for ships operating in the polar region as well as damage stability requirements for new designs and operational measures for existing vessels. Compliance with these modified standards have not historically had a material effect on our operating costs. SOLAS incorporates the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for all vessels, including passenger vessel operators.
All of our operations and ships are regularly audited by various national authorities, and we are required to maintain the relevant certificates of compliance with the ISM Code.

Table of Contents
Our ships are subject to various security requirements, including the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (“ISPS Code”), which is part of SOLAS, and the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”), which applies to ships that operate in U.S. ports. In order to satisfy these security requirements, we implement security measures, conduct vessel security assessments, and develop security plans. The security plans for all of our ships have been submitted to and approved by the Recognized Security Organization on behalf of the ships' flag state and are in compliance with the ISPS Code and the MTSA.
The Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to passenger vessels which embark or include port stops within the United States, requires the implementation of certain safety design features as well as the establishment of practices for the reporting of and dealing with allegations of crime. The cruise industry supported this legislation and we believe that our internal standards are generally as strict or stricter than the law requires. Some provisions of the act call for regulations which have not been finalized. We do not expect the pending regulations will have a material impact to our operations.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various international and national laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under such laws and regulations, we are generally prohibited from discharging materials other than food waste into the waterways. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations. From time to time, environmental and other regulators consider more stringent regulations, which may affect our operations and increase our compliance costs. We believe that the impact of ships on the global environment will continue to be an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world and, accordingly, may subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future, including the items described below.
Our ships are subject to the International Maritime Organization’s (‘‘IMO’’) regulations under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the ‘‘MARPOL Regulations’’) and the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments (Ballast Water Management Convention), in addition to other regional and national regulations such as EU Directives and the US Vessel General Permit, which includes requirements designed to minimize pollution by oil, sewage, garbage, air emissions and the transfer of non-native/non-indigenous species. We have obtained the relevant international compliance certificates relating to oil, sewage, air pollution prevention and ballast water for all of our ships.
The MARPOL Regulations imposed reduced global limitations on the sulfur content of emissions emitted by ships operating worldwide to 0.5% as of January 1, 2020, which was reduced from 3.5%. We do not expect that this increased limitation will have a material impact to our results of operations largely due to a number of mitigating steps we have taken over the last several years, including equipping all of our new ships delivered during or after 2014 with advanced emissions purification ("AEP") systems covering all engines and actively developing and installing AEP systems on the majority of our remaining fleet.
The MARPOL Regulations also establish special Emission Control Areas (‘‘ECAs’’) with additional stringent limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. There are four established ECAs that restrict sulfur emissions: the Baltic Sea, the North Sea/English Channel, certain waters surrounding the North American coast, and the waters surrounding Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Caribbean ECA”). Ships operating in these sulfur ECAs have been required to reduce their emissions sulfur content to 0.1%. This reduction has not had a significant impact on our results of operations to date due to the mitigating steps described above.
We continue to implement our AEP system strategy for both our ships on order and our existing fleet. As our new ships are delivered and additional existing ships are retrofitted with AEP systems, they will provide us with additional operational and deployment flexibility.
Additionally, all new ships operating within the North American and U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA that began construction on or after January 1, 2016, and North and Baltic Sea ships constructed on or after January 1, 2021 are required to meet more stringent nitrogen oxide emission limits. We comply with these rules for those relevant ships in service. As an added measure, all of our ships under construction are being built to comply with these rules. The rules have not had and are not expected to have a significant impact to our operations or costs.
Recently IMO approved draft amendments to the MARPOL convention that will require ships to combine a technical and an operational approach (Energy Efficiency Existing Ship Index and Carbon Intensity Indicator) to reduce their carbon intensity in line with the ambition of the Initial IMO GHG Strategy, which aims to reduce carbon intensity of international shipping by 40% by 2030, compared to 2008. While there is still a considerable amount of work ahead before these amendments can be implemented, we believe the amendments could have a material impact depending on the technical and operational approaches used (such as speed optimization, engine power reduction, etc.).

Effective July 1, 2015, the European Commission adopted legislation that requires cruise ship operators with ships visiting ports in the European Union to monitor and report on the ship’s annual carbon dioxide emissions starting in 2018. Additionally, in 2019, the IMO's monitoring and reporting system (IMO data and collection system), which is applicable to all ship itineraries, entered into force. While compliance with these regulations did not materially impact our costs or results of operations, the legislations contemplate further obligations and restrictions which could ultimately result in additional costs or charges associated with carbon dioxide emissions.
The IMO Ballast Water Management Convention, which came in effect in 2017, requires ships that carry and discharge ballast water to meet specific discharge standards by installing Ballast Water Treatment Systems by 2023. Compliance with this regulation has not had a material effect on our results of operations and we do not expect the continuing compliance with this regulation to have a material effect on our results of operations.
Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - "Environmental, labor, health and safety, financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase costs" for further discussion of the risks associated with the regulations discussed above.
Consumer Financial Responsibility Regulations
We are required to obtain certificates from the United States Federal Maritime Commission relating to our ability to satisfy liability in cases of non-performance of obligations to guests, as well as casualty and personal injury. As a condition to obtaining the required certificates, we generally arrange through our insurers for the provision of surety for our ship-operating companies. The required amount is currently $32.0 million per operator and is subject to additional consumer price index based adjustments.
We are also required by the United Kingdom, Norway, Finland and the Baltics to establish our financial responsibility for any liability resulting from the non-performance of our obligations to guests from these jurisdictions. In the United Kingdom we are currently required by the Association of British Travel Agents to provide performance bonds totaling approximately £110 million. Additionally, we were required by the Civil Aviation Authority to provide performance bonds totaling £16.6 million. The Norwegian Travel Guarantee Fund requires us to maintain performance bonds in varying amounts during the course of the year to cover our financial responsibility in Norway, Finland and the Baltics.
Certain other jurisdictions also require that we establish financial responsibility to our guests resulting from the non-performance of our obligations; however, the related amounts do not have a material effect on our costs.
Taxation of the Company
The following is a summary of our principal taxes, exemptions and special regimes. In addition to or instead of income taxation, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose some tax or fee, or both, based on guest headcount, tonnage or some other measure. We also collect and remit value added tax (VAT) or sales tax in many jurisdictions where we operate.
Our consolidated operations are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the owning and operating of passenger cruise ships in international transportation.
U.S. Income Taxation
The following is a discussion of the application of the U.S. federal and state income tax laws to us and is based on the current provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, Treasury Department regulations, administrative rulings, court decisions and the relevant state tax laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions of the states where we have business operations. All of the foregoing is subject to change, and any such change could affect the accuracy of this discussion.
Application of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code
We, Celebrity Cruises, Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and many of our ship-owning subsidiaries, depending upon the itineraries of their ships, receive income from sources within the United States. Additionally, our United Kingdom tonnage tax company is a ship-operating company classified as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes that may earn U.S. source income. Under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain foreign corporations may exclude from gross income (and effectively from branch profits tax as such earnings do not give rise to effectively connected earnings and profits) U.S. source income derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships, including income from the leasing of such ships.
A foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part: (1) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States; and (2) the stock of the corporation (or the direct or indirect corporate parent thereof) is “primarily and regularly traded on an

Table of Contents
established securities market” in the United States. In the opinion of our U.S. tax counsel, Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP, based on the representations and assumptions set forth in that opinion, we, Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd. and relevant ship-owning subsidiaries with U.S. source shipping income qualify for the benefits of Section 883 because we and each of those subsidiaries are incorporated in Liberia or Bahamas, which are qualifying countries, and our common stock is primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States (i.e., we are a "publicly traded" corporation). If, in the future, (1) Liberia or Bahamas no longer qualify as equivalent exemption jurisdictions, and we do not reincorporate in a jurisdiction that does qualify for the exemption, or (2) we fail to qualify as a publicly traded corporation, we and all of our ship-owning or operating subsidiaries that rely on Section 883 to exclude qualifying income from gross income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on their U.S. source shipping income and income from activities incidental thereto.
We believe that most of our income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, including our U.K. tonnage tax company which is considered a division for U.S. tax purposes, is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships and, therefore, is exempt from taxation under Section 883.
Regulations under Section 883 list activities that are not considered by the Internal Revenue Service to be incidental to the international operation of ships including the sale of air and land transportation, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise tours. Our income from these activities that is earned from sources within the United States will be subject to U.S. taxation.
Taxation in the Absence of an Exemption Under Section 883
If we, the operator of our vessels, Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd., or our ship-owning subsidiaries were to fail to meet the requirements of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, or if the provision was repealed, then, as explained below, such companies would be subject to U.S. income taxation on a portion of their income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships.
Because we, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. conduct a trade or business in the United States, we, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. would be taxable at regular corporate rates on our separate company taxable income (i.e., without regard to the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries) on income which is effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business (generally only income from U.S. sources). In addition, if any of our earnings and profits effectively connected with our U.S. trade or business were withdrawn, or were deemed to have been withdrawn, from our U.S. trade or business, those withdrawn amounts would be subject to a “branch profits” tax at the rate of 30%. We, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. would also be potentially subject to tax on portions of certain interest paid by us at rates of up to 30%.
If Section 883 were not available to our ship-owning subsidiaries, each such subsidiary would be subject to a special 4% tax on its U.S. source gross transportation income, if any, each year because it does not have a fixed place of business in the United States and its income is derived from the leasing of a ship.
Other United States Taxation
We, Celebrity Cruises Inc. and Silversea Cruises Ltd. earn U.S. source income from activities not considered incidental to international shipping. The tax on such income is not material to our results of operation for all years presented.
State Taxation
We, Celebrity Cruises Inc., Silversea Cruises Ltd. and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes which are generally imposed on each state’s portion of the U.S. source income subject to federal income taxes. Additionally, the state of Alaska subjects an allocated portion of the total income of companies doing business in Alaska and certain other affiliated companies to Alaska corporate state income taxes and also imposes a 33% tax on adjusted gross income from onboard gambling activities conducted in Alaska waters. This did not have a material impact to our results of operations for all years presented.
Maltese and Spanish Income Taxation
Effective July 31, 2016, we sold 51% of our interest in Pullmantur Holdings S.L. ("Pullmantur Holdings"), the parent company of the Pullmantur brand. We account for our retained investment under the equity method of accounting. There was no tax impact to us as a result of this sale transaction. The Pullmantur group continues to be subject to the tax laws of Spain and Malta, among others.
Under the sale agreement, we remain responsible for pre-sale tax matters with respect to years that are still open under the statute of limitations.

United Kingdom Income Taxation
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we operated 17 ships under the United Kingdom tonnage tax regime (“U.K. tonnage tax”).
Companies subject to U.K. tonnage tax pay a corporate tax on a notional profit determined with reference to the net tonnage of qualifying vessels. The requirements for a company to qualify for the U.K. tonnage tax regime include being subject to U.K. corporate income tax, operating qualifying ships, which are strategically and commercially managed in the United Kingdom, and fulfilling a seafarer training requirement.
Relevant shipping profits include income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities. Our U.K. income from non-shipping activities which do not qualify under the U.K. tonnage tax regime and which are not considered significant, remain subject to regular U.K. corporate income tax.
Chinese Taxation
Our U.K. tonnage tax company operates ships in international transportation in China. The income earned from this operation is exempt from taxation in China under the U.K./China double tax treaty and other circulars addressing indirect taxes. Changes to or failure to qualify for the treaty or circular could cause us to lose the benefits provided which would have a material impact on our results of operations. Our Chinese income from non-shipping activities or from shipping activities not qualifying for treaty or circular protection and which are considered insignificant, remain subject to Chinese taxation.
Other Taxation
We and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to value-added and other indirect taxes most of which are reclaimable, zero-rated or exempt.

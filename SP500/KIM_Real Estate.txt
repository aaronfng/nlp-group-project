Overview

 

Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, is one of North America’s largest publicly traded owners and operators of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets in the U.S.  The terms “Kimco,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Kimco Realty Corporation and our subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.  In statements regarding qualification as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), such terms refer solely to Kimco Realty Corporation. The Company’s mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders.

 

The Company began operations through its predecessor, The Kimco Corporation, which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders. In 1973, these principals formed the Company as a Delaware corporation, and, in 1985, the operations of The Kimco Corporation were merged into the Company. The Company completed its initial public stock offering (the “IPO”) in November 1991, and, commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992, elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined in the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries that made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), that permit the Company to engage through such TRSs in certain business activities that the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state taxes on its income, and the Company includes a provision for taxes in its consolidated financial statements.  In 1994, the Company reorganized as a Maryland corporation. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S&P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap companies, most of which are U.S. corporations. The Company's common stock, Class L Depositary Shares and Class M Depositary Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbols “KIM”, “KIMprL”, and “KIMprM”, respectively.

 

The Company is a self-administered REIT and has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. The Company’s ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company’s investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management.

The Company began to expand its operations through the development of real estate and the construction of shopping centers but revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition and redevelopment of existing shopping centers that include a grocery component. The Company also expanded internationally within Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru, but has since substantially liquidated its investments in Mexico and has completely exited Canada, Chile, Brazil and Peru. More recently the Company, on a selective basis, embarked on several ground-up development and re-development projects which include residential and mixed-use components.

 

The Company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs, in which the Company has noncontrolling interests. The Company earns management fees, acquisition fees, disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics.

 

In addition, the Company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and, from time to time, provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management’s judgment, priced below the value of the underlying assets, however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets.

 

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had interests in 400 shopping center properties (the “Combined Shopping Center Portfolio”), aggregating 70.1 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”), located in 27 states. In addition, the Company had 122 other property interests, primarily through the Company’s preferred equity investments and other real estate investments, totaling 5.4 million square feet of GLA.

 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

 

In March 2020, COVID-19 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) and declared a national emergency throughout the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected businesses, economies, and financial markets worldwide and has caused significant volatility in U.S. and international debt and equity markets. The impact of COVID-19 on the retail industry for both landlords and tenants has been wide ranging, including, but not limited to, the temporary closures of many businesses, "shelter in place" orders, social distancing guidelines and other governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There has also been reduced consumer spending due to job losses, government restrictions in response to COVID-19 and other effects attributable to COVID-19. 

 

The Company is aware of the critical role its shopping centers play in the communities they serve, often providing access to essential goods and services such as groceries, drug stores, and medical care. The Company’s shopping centers have remained open throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to provide access to these essential goods and services, and the Company has taken steps to protect the shoppers and tenants at its sites, following the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the WHO.

 

The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant economic uncertainty and volatility and has considerably impacted the Company’s stakeholders. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows since its onset. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and difficult to predict. The Company’s business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that the Company is not able to predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be, taken in response to the pandemic, the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines, the impact on economic activity from the pandemic and actions taken in response, the effect on the Company’s tenants and their businesses, the ability of tenants to make their rental payments, additional closures of tenants’ businesses and the impact of opening and reclosing of communities in response to COVID-19. Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company will continue to monitor the economic, financial, and social conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. In addition, the Company will continue to monitor for any material or adverse effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

 

Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s shopping centers have remained open; however, a substantial number of tenants had or continue to have temporarily or permanently closed their businesses. Others had, or continue to have, shortened their operating hours or offered reduced services. The Company has also had a substantial number of tenants that have made late or partial rent payments, requested a deferral of rent payments, forgiveness of rent payments or defaulted on rent payments. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Company has seen an increase in the number of tenants filing for bankruptcy, some of which emerged from bankruptcy prior to December 31, 2020. The Company continues to evaluate the impact bankruptcy filings have or will have on collections, vacancies and future rental income.

Business Objective and Strategies

 

Over the past several years, the Company has transformed its portfolio, focusing on major metropolitan-area U.S. markets, predominantly on the East and West coasts and in the Sunbelt region, which are supported by strong demographics, significant projected population growth, and where the Company perceives significant barriers to entry.  As a result of this transformation, the Company now owns a predominantly grocery-anchored portfolio clustered in the nation’s top markets which has positioned the Company to address many of the challenges brought upon by COVID-19. As of December 31, 2020, the Company derived 84.6% of its annualized base rent from its top major metro markets.

 

The Company’s focus on high-quality locations has led to significant opportunities for value creation through the reinvestment in its assets to add density, replace outdated shopping center concepts, and better meet changing consumer demands. In order to add density to existing properties, the Company has obtained multi-family entitlements for 4,984 units of which 1,266 units have been constructed as of December 31, 2020. The Company continues to place strategic emphasis on live/work/play environments and in reinvesting in its existing assets, while building shareholder value. This philosophy is exemplified by the Company’s Signature SeriesTM properties Dania Pointe, Grand Parkway Marketplace, Kentlands Market Square, Lincoln Square, Mill Station, Pentagon Centre, Suburban Square and The Boulevard.

 

The strength and security of the Company’s balance sheet remains central to its strategy.  The Company’s strong balance sheet and liquidity position are evidenced by its investment grade unsecured debt ratings (Baa1/BBB+) by two major ratings agencies.  The Company maintains one of the longest average debt maturity profiles in the REIT industry, now at 10.9 years.  The Company expects to continue to take steps to reduce leverage, unencumber assets and improve its debt coverage metrics as redevelopment and development projects continue to come online and contribute additional cash flow growth.

 

Business Objective

 

The Company’s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operators of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by:
  	

●
	

increasing the value of its existing portfolio of properties and generating higher levels of portfolio growth;
  	

●
	

increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders;
  	

●
	

continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers; and
  	

●
	

increasing capital appreciation.

 

Business Strategies

 

The Company’s stronger transformed portfolio, over time, should enable the Company to maintain higher occupancy levels, rental rates and rental growth. With the COVID-19 pandemic affecting much of the retail sector the Company further concentrated its business objectives to three main areas as follows:

** The “PLUS” business encompasses investment opportunities with retailers who have significant real estate holdings. The Company believes it can utilize its Structured Investment Program to take advantage of opportunities resulting from market dislocation in the form of preferred equity investments and/or mezzanine financing for qualified real estate owners in need of capital.

 

To effectively execute these strategies the Company seeks to:
  	

●
	

significantly increase its leasing efforts over the next several years to offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;
  	

●
	

increase rental rates where possible through the leasing of space to new tenants;
  	

●
	

attract a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers at its properties, with a focus on essential tenants such as grocers and home improvement;
  	

●
	

renew leases with existing tenants;
  	

●
	

decrease vacancy levels and duration of vacancy;
  	

●
	

monitor operating costs and overhead;
  	

●
	

retail re-tenanting, renovating, expanding and redeveloping existing shopping centers to obtain the highest and best use to maximize the real estate value, which could include acquiring adjacent land parcels;
  	

●
	

selectively acquire established income-producing real estate properties and properties requiring significant re-tenanting and redevelopment, primarily in geographic regions in which the Company presently operates;

●
	

continue to assess its portfolio and dispose of certain underperforming properties;
  	

●
	

provide unmatched tenant services deriving from decades of experience managing retail properties;
  	

●
	

assist small shop tenants during the COVID-19 pandemic to enable them to continue to successfully operate; and
  	

●
	

provide communities with a "just around the corner" destination for everyday living goods and services.

 

The Company has established certain areas of focus which it believes will advance the execution of its strategies over the coming years:

 
pillars2020.gif

 

The Company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base. As of December 31, 2020, no single open-air shopping center accounted for more than 2.0% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest, or more than 2.0% of the Company’s total shopping center GLA. Furthermore, at December 31, 2020, the Company’s single largest tenant represented only 4.0%, and the Company’s five largest tenants aggregated less than 12.6%, of the Company’s annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest.

 

As one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nation's largest owners and operators of open-air shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts. Management is associated with and/or actively participates in many shopping center and REIT industry organizations. Notwithstanding these relationships, there are numerous regional and local commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors who compete with the Company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the Company’s properties.

The health and safety of the Company’s employees and their families is a top priority. The Company always takes the necessary steps to protect its employees, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic where employees were empowered to work from home and care for their family members and children, whose lives have also been impacted. The Company will continue to evaluate individual situations as they arise and adjust its approach as appropriate, with the goal of enabling its employees to be as productive as possible while offering them the flexibility they need to care for themselves and their families.  The following are steps that were taken by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:

 
  	

●
	Transitioned the entire workforce from full-time office to flexible work from home arrangement, which the Company successfully continued since March 2020.  This included immediate and extensive technology training on virtual meetings and remote working as well as safety protocols. 
  	

●
	Business travel has been stopped with relatively few business-essential exceptions. 
  	

●
	The Company has benefited from recent investments in new technology and software over the last year, as its entire team is equipped with new laptops and cellular capability to enable them to work remotely. 
  	

●
	The Company’s human resources and information technology teams are available to all employees to address any needs or concerns they may have. 
  	

●
	Associates will be provided paid time off to care for themselves or family members diagnosed with COVID-19. 
  	

●
	The Company has increased communications at all levels and has initiated bi-weekly company-wide virtual meetings such that executives are accessible to answer any questions and transparently keep associates informed.

The Company recognizes that climate change is one of the most significant stakeholder issues of our times, threatening the viability of economic and environmental systems globally. As a real estate portfolio owner, the Company monitors physical and transition risks as well as opportunities posed to its business by climate change and quantifies and discloses the climate impacts of its activities. The Company’s science-based emissions reduction goals are aligned with the Paris Climate Accord and put the company on pace to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
Kansas City Southern, a Delaware corporation, is a holding company with domestic and international rail operations in North America that are strategically focused on the growing north/south freight corridor connecting key commercial and industrial markets in the central United States (“U.S.”) with major industrial cities in Mexico. As used herein, “KCS” or the “Company” may refer to Kansas City Southern or, as the context requires, to one or more subsidiaries of Kansas City Southern.
KCS controls and owns all of the stock of The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCSR”), a U.S. Class I railroad founded in 1887. KCSR serves a ten-state region in the midwest and southeast regions of the United States and has the shortest north/south rail route between Kansas City, Missouri and several key ports along the Gulf of Mexico in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.
KCS controls and owns all of the stock of Kansas City Southern de México, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM”). Through its 50-year concession from the Mexican government (the “Concession”), which could expire in 2047 unless extended, KCSM operates a key commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system and has as its core route the most strategic portion of the shortest, most direct rail passageway between Mexico City and Laredo, Texas. Laredo is a principal international gateway through which a substantial portion of rail and truck traffic between the United States and Mexico crosses the border. KCSM serves most of Mexico’s principal industrial cities and three of its major seaports. KCSM’s rail lines provide exclusive rail access to the United States and Mexico border crossing at Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. Under the Concession, KCSM has the right to use and operate the southern half of the rail bridge at Laredo, Texas, which spans the Rio Grande River between the United States and Mexico. The Company owns the northern half of this bridge through its ownership of Mexrail, Inc. (“Mexrail”).
KCSM also provides exclusive rail access to the port of Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Ocean. The Mexican government developed the port at Lazaro Cardenas principally to serve Mexican markets and as an alternative to the U.S. west coast ports for Asian and South American traffic bound for North America.
The Company wholly owns Mexrail which, in turn, wholly owns The Texas Mexican Railway Company (“Tex-Mex”). Tex-Mex owns a 160-mile rail line extending from Laredo, Texas to the port city of Corpus Christi, Texas, which connects the operations of KCSR with KCSM.
The KCS coordinated rail network (KCSR, KCSM and Tex-Mex, including trackage rights) comprises approximately 7,100 route miles extending from the midwest and southeast portions of the United States south into Mexico and connects with all other Class I railroads, providing shippers with an effective alternative to other railroad routes and giving direct access to Mexico and the southeast and southwest United States through alternate interchange hubs.
Panama Canal Railway Company (“PCRC”), an unconsolidated joint venture company owned equally by KCS and Mi-Jack Products, Inc. (“Mi-Jack”), was awarded a concession from the Republic of Panama to reconstruct and operate the Panama Canal Railway, a 47-mile railroad located adjacent to the Panama Canal that provides international container shipping companies with a railway transportation alternative to the Panama Canal. The concession was awarded in 1998 for an initial term of 25 years with an automatic renewal for an additional 25-year term. The Panama Canal Railway is a north-south railroad traversing the isthmus of Panama between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
Other subsidiaries and affiliates of KCS include the following:
•KCSM Servicios, S.A. de C.V. (“KCSM Servicios”), a wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiary that provides employee services to KCSM;
•Meridian Speedway, LLC (“MSLLC”), a seventy percent-owned consolidated affiliate that owns the former KCSR rail line between Meridian, Mississippi and Shreveport, Louisiana, which is the portion of the rail line between Dallas, Texas and Meridian known as the “Meridian Speedway.” Norfolk Southern Corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Alabama Great Southern Railroad Company, owns the remaining thirty percent of MSLLC;
•TFCM, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“TCM”), a forty-five percent-owned unconsolidated affiliate that operates a bulk liquid terminal in San Luis Potosí, Mexico;
•Ferrocarril y Terminal del Valle de México, S.A. de C.V. (“FTVM”), a twenty-five percent-owned unconsolidated affiliate that provides railroad services as well as ancillary services in the greater Mexico City area; and

•PTC-220, LLC (“PTC-220”), a fourteen percent-owned unconsolidated affiliate that holds the licenses to large blocks of radio spectrum and other assets for Positive Train Control (“PTC”). See Government Regulation section for further information regarding PTC.
MARKETS SERVED

					
	
2020 Revenues
Business Mix
Chemical and petroleum. This commodity group includes products such as chemicals, plastics, petroleum, liquefied petroleum gas, and petroleum refined products, such as gasoline and diesel. KCS transports these products across its network and through interchanges with other rail carriers. Refined fuels and liquefied petroleum gas groups of commodities supply Mexican demand. The chemical and plastic products are used in the automotive, housing and packaging industries as well as in general manufacturing. KCS hauls petroleum products across its network and as U.S. petroleum refineries have continued to increase their refining capacity, they have coordinated with KCS to develop additional long-term storage opportunities that complement a fluid freight railroad operation.
	
ksu-20201231_g2.jpg
Industrial and consumer products. This commodity group includes forest products as well as metals and scrap. Forest products consist of shipments to and from paper and lumber mills in the southeast United States timber-producing region that KCS serves directly and indirectly through its various short-line connections. The United States is an important source of pulp paper and scrap paper for Mexico that ships by rail through KCS’s network. Metals and scrap consist of shipments of flat steel and long product as well as other minor moves of ores such as iron, zinc and copper. The majority of steel produced and metallic ore mined in Mexico are consumed within Mexico. Steel slab is used to make steel coils and plate-products that usually ship via rail. Higher-end finished products such as steel coils are used by Mexican manufacturers in automobiles, household appliances, the oil and gas industry, and other consumer goods that are imported from the United States through land borders and the seaports served by KCS’s rail network. KCS also transports steel coils, plates and pipe from U.S. and Mexican-based mini-mills to locations in the U.S. and Mexico for oil drilling, appliance and automotive applications. This commodity group also includes U.S. military transports, Mexico and U.S. domestic cement shipments and appliances manufactured in Mexico that are imported into the United States.
Agriculture and minerals. The agriculture and minerals commodity group consists primarily of grain and food products. Shipper demand for agriculture products is affected by competition among sources of grain and grain products, as well as price fluctuations in international markets for key commodities. In the United States, KCS’s rail lines receive and originate shipments of grain and grain products for delivery to feed mills and food and industrial consumers in the U.S. and Mexico. United States export grain shipments and Mexico import grain shipments include primarily corn, wheat, and soybeans. Food products consist mainly of soybean meal, grain meal, oils, distillers dried grains, corn syrup and sugar. Other shipments consist of a variety of products including ores, minerals, clay and glass used across North America.
Energy. The energy commodity group includes coal, frac sand, petroleum coke and crude oil. KCS hauls unit trains (trains transporting a single commodity from one source to one destination) of coal for electric generating plants in the central United States. The coal originates from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and is interchanged to KCS at Kansas City, Missouri. Coal mined in the midwest United States is transported in non-unit trains to industrial consumers such as paper mills, steel mills, and cement companies. Frac sand originating primarily in Wisconsin, Illinois or Iowa is delivered to transloads located in northeast Texas, northern Louisiana and south Texas for distribution to gas and oil wells in the region. Frac sand business in Mexico is primarily for industrial purposes such as auto glass and bottle manufacturing. KCS’s shipments of frac sand to support the drilling industry have diminished over time as the use of in-basin frac sand has largely replaced frac sand originating in the upper Midwest. KCS transports petroleum coke from refineries in the United States to various industries in

the U.S. and Mexico including export through the Pabtex terminal located in Port Arthur, TX. The majority of crude by rail business originates in Canada, with spot shipments coming from west Texas, and is delivered to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and tank farms in Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama.
Intermodal. The intermodal freight sector consists primarily of hauling freight containers or truck trailers on behalf of steamship lines, motor carriers, and intermodal marketing companies with rail carriers serving as long-distance haulers. KCS serves and supports the U.S. and Mexican markets, as well as cross-border traffic between the U.S. and Mexico. In light of the importance of trade between Asia and North America, the Company believes the Port of Lazaro Cardenas continues to be a strategically beneficial location for ocean carriers, manufacturers and retailers. Equally important, foreign direct investment in Mexico has caused the KCS Mexico/U.S. cross border corridor to emerge as an increasingly important tool for freight flow. The Company also provides premium service to customers over its line from Dallas through the Meridian Speedway— a critical link in creating the most direct route between the southwest and southeast/northeast U.S.
Automotive. KCS provides rail transportation to every facet of the automotive industry supply chain, including automotive manufacturers, assembly plants and distribution centers throughout North America. In addition, KCS transports finished vehicles imported and exported to and from various countries through a distribution facility at the Port of Lazaro Cardenas.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The Company’s United States operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to all businesses, subject to federal preemption under certain circumstances. Rail operations are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration (“FRA”) and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), as well as other federal and state regulatory agencies. The STB has jurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates and charges, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines, applications for line extensions and construction, and consolidation or merger with, or acquisition of control of, rail common carriers. DOT and OSHA each has jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. In 2008, the President of the United States signed the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 into law, which, among other things, revised hours of service for train and certain other employees and mandated implementation of PTC at certain locations by the end of 2015. PTC is a technology designed to help prevent train-to-train collisions, overspeed derailments, incursions into rail work zones, and entry into main line track if a switch is misaligned at certain locations, including main line track where toxic inhalation hazard or poison inhalation hazard movements occur or where passenger operations occur. The Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2015 amended the PTC deadline set by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 to require implementation of PTC by the end of 2018, and then further extended to December 31, 2020. By the end of 2018, the Company implemented PTC on all required sections of its rail network, locomotives and wayside assets. The Company completed interoperability with the required Class I freight railroads and Amtrak in June 2020 in compliance with the December 31, 2020 deadline. The implementation of PTC increased operating costs, and the number of employees the Company employs, and has required significant investments in new safety technology. The Company will continue to make investments in new safety technology.
KCS’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental regulations. These laws cover discharges to water, air emissions, toxic substances, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. These regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.
Primary regulatory oversight of the Company’s Mexican operations is provided by the Mexican Agencia Reguladora del Transporte Ferroviario (“Regulatory Agency of Rail Transportation” or “ARTF”). The ARTF establishes regulations concerning railway safety and operations, and is responsible for resolving disputes between railways and customers. KCSM must register its maximum rates with the ARTF and make regular reports to the ARTF and the Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes (“Secretary of Communications and Transportation” or “SCT”). KCSM must provide reports on investments, traffic volumes, theft and vandalism on the general right of way, customer complaints, fuel consumption, number of locomotives, railcars and employees, and activities around maintenance of way, sidings and spurs, among other financial information and reports. The Company may freely set rates on a non-discriminatory basis up to the maximum rates registered with the ARTF. At any time, the ARTF may request additional information regarding the determination of such rates and may

Table of Contents
issue recommendations with respect to proposed rate increases. If the ARTF or another party considers there to be no effective competition, they may request an opinion from the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica (“Mexican Antitrust Commission” or “COFECE”) regarding market conditions. If the COFECE determines that there is no effective competition for particular movements, the ARTF could set rates for those movements or grant limited trackage rights to another railroad while the condition of no effective competition remains.
KCSM holds a Concession from the Mexican government until June 2047 (exclusively through 2027, subject to certain trackage and haulage rights granted to other concessionaires), which is renewable under certain conditions for additional periods of up to 50 years. The Concession authorizes KCSM to provide freight transportation services over north-east rail lines, which are a primary commercial corridor of the Mexican railroad system. KCSM is required to provide freight railroad services to all users on a fair and non-discriminatory basis and in accordance with efficiency and safety standards approved periodically by the Mexican government. KCSM has the right to use, but does not own, all track and buildings that are necessary for the rail lines’ operation. KCSM is obligated to maintain the right of way, track structure, buildings and related maintenance facilities to the operational standards specified in the Concession agreement and to return the assets in that condition at the end of the Concession period. During the remainder of the Concession period, KCSM is required to pay the Mexican government an annual concession duty equal to 1.25% of gross revenues. The ARTF may request information to verify KCSM´s compliance with the Concession and any applicable regulatory framework.
The Company’s Mexican operations are subject to Mexican federal and state laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment through the establishment of standards for water discharge, water supply, emissions, noise pollution, hazardous substances and transportation and handling of hazardous and solid waste. The Mexican government may bring administrative and criminal proceedings and impose economic sanctions against companies that violate environmental laws, and temporarily or even permanently close non-complying facilities.
Noncompliance with applicable legal provisions may result in the imposition of fines, temporary or permanent shutdown of operations or other injunctive relief, criminal prosecution or, with respect to KCSM, the termination of the Concession. KCS maintains environmental provisions that are believed by management to be appropriate with respect to known and existing environmental contamination of its properties that KCS may be responsible to remedy.
Government regulations are further discussed within Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Information and Results of Operations — Mexico Regulatory and Legal Updates.
COMPETITION
The Company competes against other railroads, many of which are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources. The railroad industry in North America is dominated by a few very large carriers. The larger U.S. western railroads (BNSF Railway Company and Union Pacific Railroad Company), in particular, are significant competitors of KCS because of their substantial resources and competitive routes.
In Mexico, KCSM’s operations are subject to competition from other railroads, particularly Ferrocarril Mexicano, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferromex”) and Ferrosur, S.A. de C.V. (“Ferrosur”), both controlled by Grupo Mexico S.A.B. de C.V. Ferromex and Ferrosur together are much larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than KCSM, serving most of the major ports and cities in Mexico and together owning fifty percent of FTVM, which serves industries located in the Mexico City area.
The ongoing impact of past and future rail consolidation is uncertain. However, KCS believes that its investments and strategic alliances continue to competitively position the Company to attract additional rail traffic throughout its rail network.
The Company is subject to competition from motor carriers, barge lines and other maritime shipping, which compete across certain routes in KCS’s operating areas. In the past, truck carriers have generally eroded the railroad industry’s share of total transportation revenues. Intermodal traffic and certain other traffic face highly price sensitive competition, particularly from motor carriers. However, rail carriers, including KCS, have placed an emphasis on competing in the intermodal marketplace and working with motor carriers to provide end-to-end transportation of products.
While deregulation of U.S. freight rates has enhanced the ability of railroads to compete with each other and with alternative modes of transportation, this increased competition has generally resulted in downward pressure on freight rates

since deregulation. Competition with other railroads and other modes of transportation is generally based on the rates charged, the quality and reliability of the service provided and the quality of the carrier’s equipment for certain commodities.
RAIL SECURITY
The Company and its rail subsidiaries have continued to research, develop and implement multidisciplinary approaches to secure the Company’s assets and personnel against transnational criminal organizations that actively target transportation networks. In addition, the Company has developed a variety of vertically integrated strategies to mitigate the risk terrorist attacks could pose to the Company, its personnel and assets. Many of the specific measures the Company utilizes for these efforts are required to be kept confidential through arrangements with government agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), or through jointly-developed and implemented strategies and plans with connecting carriers.
KCSR and KCSM developed a proprietary security plan based on an industry-wide plan developed by the Association of American Railroads (“AAR”) members which focuses on comprehensive risk assessments in five areas — hazardous materials; train operations; critical physical assets; military traffic; and information technology and communications. The security plan is kept confidential, with access to the plan tightly limited to members of management with direct security and anti-terrorism implementation responsibilities. The Company participates with other AAR members in periodic drills under the industry plan to test and refine its various provisions.
The Company also uses information technology in various ways in its operations. The risks associated with this technology from cyber attacks has increased in recent years. The Company continues to monitor these threats and attempted cyber attacks, and has put in place various safeguards to protect the Company’s operations as well as its assets and digital information from cyber attacks.
To protect the confidentiality and sensitivity of both the AAR plans and the proprietary strategies the Company has developed to safeguard against criminal enterprises, terrorism, and other security and safety threats, the following paragraphs will provide only a general overview of some of these efforts.
The Company’s security activities range from periodically providing security awareness updates to KCS employees and including safety and security information on the Company’s internet website (which can be found under the “Corporate Responsibility” tab at www.kcsouthern.com) to its ongoing implementation of security plans for rail facilities in areas labeled by the DHS as High Threat Urban Areas (“HTUAs”). The Company’s other activities to bolster security against terrorism include, but are not limited to, the following:
•Conferring regularly with other railroads’ security personnel and with industry experts on security issues;
•Routing shipments of certain chemicals, which might be toxic if inhaled, pursuant to federal regulations;
•Initiating a series of over 20 voluntary action items agreed to between AAR and DHS as enhancing security in the rail industry;
•Conducting constant and targeted security training as part of the scheduled training for operating employees and managers;
•Developing smartphone applications to ensure immediate information, live video and pictures from security supervisors and protection assets pertaining to potential operational risks;
•Developing a multi-layered security model using high-speed digital imaging, system velocity and covert and overt security filters to mitigate the risk of illicit activity;
•Measuring key security metrics to ensure positive risk mitigation and product integrity trends;
•Performing constant due diligence with the existing security model and by benchmarking rail security, including cyber security, on a world-wide basis to monitor threat streams related to rail incidents;
•Implementing a Tactical Intelligence Center by KCSM, which provides constant training with core members in new technology helping to prevent, detect, deter, deny and respond to potentially illicit activities; and
•Deploying an array of non-intrusive technologies including, but not limited to, digital video surveillance and analytics as part of an intelligent video security solution, including a closed circuit television platform with geo-fencing for intrusion detection, to allow for remote viewing access to monitor ports of entry, intermodal and rail yards.

Table of Contents
In addition, the Company utilizes dedicated security personnel with extensive special operations forces, intelligence, and law enforcement backgrounds to oversee the ongoing and increasingly complex security efforts of the Company in both the United States and Mexico. While the risk of theft and vandalism is higher in Mexico, KCSM remains among the safest methods of transportation for freight shipments in Mexico. KCSM’s record in rail safety is due in large part to the implementation of a multi-layered safety and security process throughout the KCSM network. In addition to having its own internal system, the process is connected to, and supported by a high level of federal, state and local law enforcement. A primary focus of this effort involves maintaining constant diligence, intelligence and counterintelligence operations, technology-reporting applications and active vigilance while enhancing overall system velocity, which reduces the residual risk for incidents to occur.
RAILWAY LABOR ACT
Labor relations in the U.S. railroad industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation under the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”). Under the RLA, national labor agreements are renegotiated on an industry-wide scale when they become open for modification, but their terms remain in effect until new agreements are reached or the RLA’s procedures (which include mediation, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of presidential intervention) are exhausted. Contract negotiations with the various unions generally take place over an extended period of time and the Company rarely experiences work stoppages during negotiations. Wages, health and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues have traditionally been addressed during these negotiations.
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
Approximately 70% of KCSR employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements do not have expiration dates, but rather remain in place until modified by subsequent agreements. KCSR participates in industry-wide multi-employer bargaining as a member of the National Carriers’ Conference Committee (the “NCCC”), as well as local bargaining for agreements that are limited to KCSR's property. Multi-employer agreements are subject to a procedure that allows requests for changes to be served every five years. Long-term agreements were reached voluntarily or through the arbitration process during 2017 and 2018 covering all of the participating unions. The terms of these agreements will remain in effect until new agreements are reached in the next bargaining round. In November 2019, KCSR and its unions commenced negotiations in connection with the 2020 bargaining round.
KCSM Servicios union employees are covered by one labor agreement, which was signed on April 16, 2012, between KCSM Servicios and the Sindicato de Trabajadores Ferrocarrileros de la República Mexicana (“Mexican Railroad Union”), and which remains in effect during the period of the Concession, for the purpose of regulating the relationship between the parties. Approximately 79% of KCSM Servicios employees are covered by this labor agreement. The compensation terms under this labor agreement are subject to renegotiation on an annual basis and all other benefits are subject to negotiation every two years. The parties finalized negotiations over compensation terms and benefits that will apply until June 30, 2021, along with other terms.
Union labor negotiations have not historically resulted in any strike, boycott or other disruption in the Company’s business operations.

DESCRIPTION OF HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
The employees of KCS are the Company’s greatest asset. KCS employees are the foundation of the Company’s success and keep the railroad moving every day, even during a global pandemic. The employees of KCS have a shared vision – to strive to be the fastest-growing, best-performing, most customer-focused transportation provider in North America.
A majority of the KCS workforce plays a critical role in the daily train operations and customer support. This portion of the workforce, including train crews, dispatchers, mechanical and engineering crews, field managers, and many others, cannot work from home. During the pandemic, these employees and freight rail transportation are part of what is deemed “critical infrastructure,” essential to the economy and the communities KCS serves.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately 6,522 employees, with 58% based in Mexico and 42% based in the U.S. In 2020, approximately 75% of KCS employees were represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
ksu-20201231_g3.jpgksu-20201231_g4.jpg
In managing the Company’s business, management focuses on a number of human capital measures and objectives rooted in the KCS Vision, Values and Culture (described further below, and as noted on the Company’s website at https://www.kcsouthern.com/en-us/about-us/overview/vision-values, which is not incorporated into this Form 10-K) and include the following:
•Employee Health & Safety - KCS is committed to operating in a safe, secure and responsible manner for the benefit of its employees, customers and the communities KCS serves in the U.S. and Mexico. See below for further discussion of employee health and safety as well as noted in the Company’s sustainability report at https://www.kcsouthern.com/corporate-responsibility/our-commitment/KCS-2019-Sustainability-Report.pdf (the sustainability report is not incorporated into this Form 10-K).
•Compensation and Benefits - KCS strives to offer competitive compensation, benefits and services that meets the needs of its employees including, short and long-term incentive packages, employee stock purchase plan, defined contribution plan, healthcare benefits, and wellness and employee assistance programs. Management monitors market compensation and benefits to be able to attract, retain, and promote employees and reduce turnover and its associated costs. In addition, KCS’s short and long-term incentive programs are aligned with the Company’s vision and key business objectives and are intended to motivate strong performance. KCS engages a nationally recognized outside consulting firm to objectively evaluate its compensation and benefits and benchmark them against industry peers and other similarly situated organizations.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, compensation and benefits expense totaled $476.5 million. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and results of Operations for further discussion of compensation and benefits expense.

•KCS’s Vision, Values and Culture (“KCS Culture”) - The KCS Culture is critically important to KCS’s success and is a set of guidelines, beliefs and behaviors that help define KCS and create a foundation for growth and success. KCS’s strong culture and core values should allow KCS to fulfill its vision and continue to endure in times of stress. The KCS Culture helps guide how employees make decisions, treat each other and serve customers. All employees are responsible for upholding the KCS Culture and conformance with the KCS Culture statement is 25% of the annual performance appraisal process for all management employees. Management uses performance evaluations as a tool to help strengthen relationships with employees and KCS’s Culture.
Employee Health and Safety Overview
Management seeks to instill a culture valuing employee health and safety at KCS via training, education, initiatives, equipment and a strict adherence to applicable safety rules as further described below.
Operational safety
KCS is subject to federal, state, and local government regulations in the U.S. and Mexico with regard to safety. These regulations direct safety practices in the placement of rail cars carrying certain commodities in the train, routes, inspection of equipment and track, security procedures, equipment design and construction, speed restrictions, and work rules.
Management strives to instill a culture of safety, providing on-the-job training and classroom instruction to employees. Many positions, such as locomotive engineers and conductors, have extensive requirements for certification and licensing, as required by federal regulation. Certification-eligibility is based on a variety of factors, including prior safety conduct of the applicant, compliance with applicable regulations, knowledge of operating rules and performance testing. The Company offers certification and training programs to operations groups as business needs require. These training programs focus on operating rules, safety rules, and procedures required for specific tasks.
KCS’s operational testing program provides processes for ongoing validation and understanding of, and adherence to operating rules and procedures by employees, and allows management to identify, monitor and manage potential safety risks in the business. This training is designed to gauge employees’ knowledge of and compliance with KCS rules and procedures and determine the need for remedial training or guidance. Testing plans are developed based upon, among other things, a particular location’s risks, recent trends, injuries or accidents and prior operational test performance.
Safety technology
KCS uses advanced technologies to help employees enhance operational safety including the following:
•Advanced Inspection Equipment — KCS uses technology to monitor, in real-time, the approximately 7,100 route miles of track, bridges, and tunnels that KCS uses in its operations. KCS employees and contractors inspect railroad tracks using specialized equipment such as track geometry cars, ground-penetrating radar, and laser technology. Additionally, different types of wayside detectors are positioned along the rail network to monitor the condition of the wheels on passing trains. These specialized technologies alert railroads to potential defects and help enable KCS to schedule maintenance in a timely manner.

•PTC — Since 2008, KCSR has worked to implement PTC, the largest and most complex safety system in the history of the railroad industry. PTC is an advanced technology system designed to automatically stop a train before certain incidents occur and protect KCS’s employees, customers and communities along the network. The Company has invested $257.4 million in PTC since 2008. PTC aims to prevent the following:
◦Train-to-train collisions;
◦Derailments caused by excessive train speed;
◦Train movements through misaligned track switches;
◦Unauthorized train entry into work zones.
•Asset Health Strategic Initiative (“AHSI”) — AHSI is a multi-year rail industry program that applies information technology processes to help improve the safety and performance of freight cars and locomotives across North America. The program aims to help reduce mechanical service interruptions, improve the quality of railcar inspections, and increase rail yard and repair shop efficiencies by consolidating equipment information, including ownership information, repair and inspection history, and company recalls, among other things.
Health and Safety during COVID-19 pandemic
During the outbreak in March 2020 of the novel Coronavirus (“COVID-19”), which has been declared a pandemic, the U.S. and Mexico governments deemed rail transportation as “critical infrastructure” providing essential services during the global emergency. As a provider of critical infrastructure, Kansas City Southern has an obligation to keep employees working and freight operations moving. During this period, the Company strives to remain focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of its employees and the communities in which it operates while working to maintain the continuity of its business operations.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, KCS created a dedicated crisis team that implemented business continuity plans to help ensure the ongoing availability of its transportation services. KCS took a variety of health and safety measures, including separating dispatching and crew operations, implementing enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in its facilities and locomotives, implementing remote work policies where possible, performing temperature checks and requiring facial coverings. As a result, the Company did not experience significant COVID-19 related disruptions in its railroad operations during 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized approximately $10.0 million of expense related to COVID-19 for the protection of its employees and the continuity of business operations.

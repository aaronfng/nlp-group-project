OUR BUSINESS

We are one of the world's largest private owners of timberlands. We own or control 10.7 million acres of timberlands in the U.S. and manage an additional 14.1 million acres of timberlands under long-term licenses in Canada. We manage these timberlands on a sustainable basis in compliance with internationally recognized forestry standards. Our objective is to maximize the long-term value of timberlands we own. We analyze each timberland acre comprehensively to understand its highest-value use. We realize this value in many ways, most notably through growing and harvesting the trees, but also by selling properties when we can create incremental value. In addition, we focus on opportunities to realize value through lease and royalty agreements for the surface and subsurface rights that exist in our ownership.

We are also one of the largest manufacturers of wood products in North America. We manufacture and distribute high-quality wood products, including structural lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products and other specialty products. These products are primarily supplied to the residential, multi-family, industrial, light commercial as well as repair and remodel markets. We operate 35 manufacturing facilities in the United States and Canada.

Sustainability and citizenship are part of our core values. In addition to practicing sustainable forestry, we focus on increasing energy and resource efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving natural resources and offering sustainable products that meet our customers' needs. We operate with world-class safety results, actively support the communities in which we operate and strive to communicate transparently with our investors and other stakeholders. We are one of only two North American forest products companies included on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, and we are also recognized for our leading performance in the areas of ethics, citizenship and gender equality.

WHO WE ARE

 

We were incorporated as Weyerhaeuser Timber Company in the state of Washington in January 1900, when Frederick Weyerhaeuser and 15 partners bought 900,000 acres of timberland. Today, we are working to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company for our shareholders, customers and employees.

REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT)

Our company is a REIT and REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, substantially eliminating the double taxation on income. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from our timberlands, including gains from the sales of our standing timber and rent from recreational leases. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (TRSs), which include our Wood Products segment and a portion of our Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segments.

Detailed financial information about our business segments and our geographic locations is provided in Note 2: Business Segments and Note 21: Geographic Areas.

EFFECT OF MARKET CONDITIONS

The health of the U.S. housing market strongly affects the performance of all our business segments. Wood Products primarily sells into the new residential building and repair and remodel markets. Demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products as well as export markets. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., generally characterized by a reduction in activity during the winter months, which in turn affects the demand for our logs and wood products. Real Estate is affected by the health of the U.S. economy and the local real estate market conditions, such as the level of supply or demand for properties sharing the same or similar characteristics as our timberlands. Energy and Natural Resources is affected by underlying demand for commodities, including oil, natural gas and minerals.

COMPETITION IN OUR MARKETS

We operate in highly competitive domestic and foreign markets, with numerous companies selling similar products. Many of our products also face competition from substitutes for wood products. We compete in our markets primarily through product quality, service levels and price. We are relentlessly focused on operational excellence, producing quality products customers want and are willing to pay for, at the lowest possible cost.

Our business segments’ competitive strategies are as follows:

 

•

Timberlands — Deliver maximum timber value from every acre we own or manage.

•

Real Estate & ENR — Deliver premiums to timberland value by identifying and monetizing higher and better use lands and capturing the full value of surface and subsurface assets.

•

Wood Products — Manufacture high-quality structural lumber, oriented strand board and engineered wood products, as well as deliver complementary building products for residential, multi-family, industrial and light commercial applications at competitive costs.

 

HUMAN CAPITAL AND TALENT MANAGEMENT

Our human capital and talent management practices strive to attract and retain diverse and talented people. Since we depend so much on our people, we focus on ensuring that we create and maintain a safe and inclusive work environment in which our employees have opportunities to develop and reach their potential.

OUR PEOPLE BY THE NUMBERS

As of December 31, 2020, we employed 9,372 employees, including 7,971 in the United States, 1,389 in Canada, and 12 in Japan. Of these employees, 2,421 are members of unions covered by multi-year collective-bargaining agreements.

SAFETY

Our highest priority is the safety of our employees, contractors and all others who come into contact with our daily operations. Our industry-leading safety results are driven by:

 

•

caring leadership with a safety-focused “tone at the top”;

•

robust safety policies and practices;

•

engaged employees with regular safety training and education and

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2020 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 2

Table of Contents

 

•

a strong company-wide focus on identifying and reducing hazards and risks.

 

We regularly review safety incidents, risk-identification reports and “near-miss” incidents and apply key learnings across our organization. Our efforts have resulted in a significant and sustained reduction in the number and severity of recordable injuries. This includes a drop in our Recordable Incident Rate, which is the number of Occupational Safety and Health Administration-defined recordable injuries/illnesses that occur in 100 workers working in one year, from 10 in 1990 to 1.56 in 2020. We remain relentlessly focused on achieving our goal of creating an injury-free workplace.

 

In 2020, our continued focus on workplace safety enabled us to quickly implement additional protocols to safeguard the health of our employees and preserve business continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT

We focus a great deal of energy and resources on the training and development of our people. We also connect key human capital management priorities, such as succession planning, leadership development and critical role placement, with our executive compensation programs by including these and related priorities in our senior executives’ annual cash bonus plan goals. To support our people development objectives we:

 

•

partner with our employees on individual development plans and provide a wide range of individual development tools;

•

annually enroll hundreds of our front-line, mid-level and future executive leaders in development programs;

•

engage in rigorous internal talent assessment and succession planning and

•

monitor and regularly review our strategies and action plans to address any workforce gaps in our organization, including gender, race and other underrepresented groups.

 

We also believe in the 70-20-10 approach to professional growth. This model acknowledges that at least 70 percent of development occurs on the job through direct experience and skill-building. Another 20 percent comes from focused relationship-building and exposure to projects, processes and perspective outside one’s normal expertise. The final 10 percent is focused on targeted training courses and development programs that help our employees achieve their own specific career goals. In 2020, our employees logged 31,415 hours of training in our online learning management system, which tracks both virtual and classroom courses delivered. In addition, we offer three classroom-based leadership development programs that focus on helping current and future leaders build these skills. We typically enroll hundreds of leaders in these in-person programs each year. However, in 2020 due to COVID-related health and safety restrictions, we converted our programs into virtual formats where viable. In addition, we developed “Leading Through Uncertainty” training to help leaders effectively manage their teams through the many challenges of 2020, and we offered several virtual seminars on managing stress and work/life balance.

DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION

We are taking action to increase diversity at all levels of our company, create a truly inclusive environment and secure, preserve and promote equity for our employees.

To help us accelerate progress in creating a truly inclusive work culture at Weyerhaeuser, we identified inclusion as one of our five core values in 2019 and formed an Inclusion Council of 20 diverse employees from across our company to help provide insights and recommendations to our senior management team. We have six focus areas: leadership and accountability; equitable practices and policies; recruiting and hiring; training and development; communication and culture; and affinity and connection. We have set targets for improvement in each category which are reviewed and reset annually. Our practices for achieving and maintaining a strong, diverse and inclusive workplace culture also include:

 

•

“no tolerance” policies regarding discrimination and harassment of employees, suppliers, customers and visitors;

•

third-party reviews of pay equity;

•

removal of names from resumes and creation of diverse hiring teams;

•

mandatory training on unconscious bias and harassment prevention;

•

ongoing company-wide communication on the importance of inclusion and

•

regular company-wide surveys and other means of anonymously collecting candid feedback to assist us in evaluating our progress and addressing any identified gaps.

 

Excluding temporary hires and part-time employees, in 2020, 40 percent of the company’s new U.S. hires met the company’s criteria for diversity, which includes race, ethnicity, gender and disability status. In response to our annual feedback survey conducted for 2020, 82 percent of our employees agreed their work environment is inclusive.

COMPANY CULTURE

We consider our strong company culture to be a competitive advantage. We are intentional in our efforts to preserve the key positives of our workplace environment, as well as continuously improving and evolving our culture. At the heart of our culture is an unwavering commitment to our core values — safety, integrity, citizenship, sustainability and inclusion. Most of these values have been ingrained in our culture for many decades; they are cited often by our employees and are visible throughout our organization. We also embrace five key behaviors that shape our culture and guide how we work together — urgency, accountability, courage, simplicity and innovation. To assess the health of our culture, we conduct regular company-wide surveys to collect candid feedback from employees and assess overall engagement. In 2020, our overall engagement score was 85 percent and our average score on questions about the strength of our values was 83 percent. Another indicator we monitor to assess the strength of our company culture is voluntary turnover, which was only 6.5 percent in 2020.

COMPETITIVE PAY & BENEFITS

We offer competitive compensation and benefits packages based on experience, knowledge and skill level that are designed to attract and retain talented employees and reward superior performance. Some of our benefits include paid parental leave, company match for retirement plans, comprehensive medical and dental coverage and paid time off.

 

 

WHAT WE DO

 

This section provides information about how we:

 

•

grow and harvest trees,

•

maximize the value of every acre we own and

•

manufacture and sell wood products.

 

For each of our business segments, we provide details about what we do, where we do it, how much we sell and where we are headed.

TIMBERLANDS

Our Timberlands segment manages 10.7 million acres of private commercial timberlands in the U.S. We own 9.9 million of those acres and control the remaining acres through long-term contracts. In addition, we have renewable, long-term licenses on 14.1 million acres of Canadian timberlands.

WHAT WE DO

Forestry Management

Our Timberlands segment:

 

•

plants seedlings to reforest harvested areas using the most effective regeneration method for the site and species (natural regeneration is employed and managed in parts of Canada and the northern U.S.);

•

manages our timberlands as the trees grow to maturity;

•

harvests trees to be converted into wood products, such as lumber, pellets, pulp and paper;

•

manages the health of our forests to sustainably maximize harvest volumes, minimize risks, and protect unique environmental, cultural, historical and recreational value and

•

offers recreational access.

 

We seek to maximize the returns from our timberlands by selling delivered logs and through stumpage sales to both internal and external customers. We leverage our expertise in forestry using research and planning systems to optimize log production and innovative planting and harvesting techniques across varying terrain. We use intensive, customized silviculture to increase forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis. We use our scale, infrastructure and supply chain expertise to deliver reliable and consistent supply to our customers.

Competitive factors within each of our market areas generally include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to wood-consuming facilities and the ability to consistently meet customer requirements. We compete in the marketplace through our ability to provide customers with a consistent and reliable supply of high-quality logs at scale volumes and competitive prices. Our customers also value our status as a Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI) certified supplier.

Sustainable Forestry Practices

We manage our forests intensively to maximize the value of every acre and produce a sustainable supply of wood fiber for our customers. At the same time, we are careful to protect biological diversity, water quality and other ecosystem values. Our working forests also provide unique environmental, cultural, historical and recreational value. We work hard to protect these and other qualities, while still managing our forests to produce financially mature timber. We follow regulatory requirements, voluntary standards and certify 100 percent of our North American timberlands under the SFI Forest Management Standard.

Canadian Forestry Operations

In Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that serve as the primary source of raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. When we harvest trees, we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government. We transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any significant profit from the harvest of timber from our licensed acres in Canada.

Timberlands Products

 

PRODUCTS

HOW THEY’RE USED

Delivered logs:

• Grade logs

• Fiber logs

Grade logs are made into lumber, plywood, veneer and other products used in residential homes, commercial structures, furniture, industrial and decorative applications. Fiber logs are sold to pulp, paper and oriented strand board mills to make products used for printing, writing, packaging, homebuilding and consumer products, as well as into renewable energy and pellets.

Timber

Standing timber is sold to third parties through stumpage sales.

Recreational leases

Timberlands are leased or permitted for recreational purposes.

Other products

Seed and seedlings grown in the U.S. and wood chips.

 

HOW WE MEASURE OUR PRODUCT

We use multiple units of measure when transacting business including:

 

•

Thousand board feet (MBF) — used in the West to measure the expected lumber recovery from a tree or log and

•

Green tons (GT) — used in the South to measure weight; factors used for conversion to product volume can vary by species, size, location and season.

 

We report Timberlands volumes in ton equivalents.

WHERE WE DO IT

As of December 31, 2020, we sustainably managed timberlands in 18 states. This included owned or contracted acres in the following locations:

 

•

2.7 million acres in the western U.S. (Oregon and Washington);

•

6.8 million acres in the southern U.S. (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia) and

•

1.2 million acres in the northern U.S. (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin).

 

In Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities. These licenses are in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Saskatchewan.

Our total timber inventory — including timber on owned and contracted land — is approximately 593 million tons. This timber inventory does not translate into a specific amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products varies according to the age, species, size and quality of the timber and will change over time as these variables adjust.

We maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory system and geographic information system (GIS). The resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed methods, including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization. The GIS component is based on GIS software that is viewed as the standard in our industry.

Timber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies. The data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level.

We also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina and Washington.

Acres include all conservation and non-harvestable areas.

 

We provide a year-round flow of logs to internal and external customers. We sell grade and fiber logs to manufacturers that produce a diverse range of products. We also sell standing timber to third parties and lease land for recreational purposes. Most of our timberlands are strategically located to take advantage of road, logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to customers.

Western United States

Our Western timberlands are well situated to serve the wood products and pulp markets in Oregon and Washington. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 30 percent of our total Western log sales volume internally. Additionally, our location on the West Coast provides access to higher-value export markets for Douglas fir and whitewood logs to Japan, China and Korea. Our largest export market is Japan, where Douglas fir is the preferred species for higher-valued post and beam homebuilding. The size and quality of our Western timberlands, coupled with their proximity to several deep-water port facilities, competitively positions us to meet the needs of Pacific Rim log markets.

Our holdings are composed primarily of Douglas fir, a species highly valued for its structural strength, stiffness and appearance. Most of our lands are located on the west side of the Cascade Mountain Range with soil and rainfall conditions considered favorable for growing this species. Our standing timber inventory is comprised of 79 percent Douglas fir, 15 percent whitewood and 6 percent hardwood.

Our management systems and supply chain expertise provide us a competitive operating advantage in a number of areas including forestry and research, harvesting, marketing and logistics. Additionally, our scale, diversity of timberlands ownership and infrastructure on the West Coast allow us to consistently and reliably supply logs to our internal and external customers year-round.

We sell recreational use permits covering approximately 2 million acres of our owned Western timberlands.

The average age of timber harvested from our Western timberlands in 2020 was 49 years. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest and replant approximately 2 percent of our Western acreage each year.

Southern United States

Our Southern timberland ownership, covering 11 states, is well situated to serve domestic wood products and pulp markets, including third-party customers and our own mills. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 22 percent of our total Southern log sales volume internally. Additionally, our Atlantic and Gulf coastal locations position us to serve an emerging Asian log export market. Our standing timber inventory is comprised of 76 percent Southern yellow pine and 24 percent hardwoods.

Operationally, we focus on efficiently harvesting and hauling logs from our ownership and capitalizing on our scale and supply chain expertise to consistently and reliably serve a broad range of customers through seasonal and weather-related events year-round.

We lease approximately 93 percent of our owned Southern acreage for recreational purposes.

The average age of timber harvested from our Southern timberlands in 2020 was 29 years. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest and replant approximately 3 percent of our acreage each year in the South.

Northern United States

Our Northern timberlands acres contain a diverse mix of temperate broadleaf hardwoods and mixed conifer species across timberlands located in five states. We grow over 50 species and market over 500 product grades to a diverse mix of customers.

Our large-diameter cherry, red oak and hard maple sawlogs and veneer logs serve domestic and export furniture markets. Our maple and other appearance woods are used in furniture and high-value decorative applications. In addition to high-value hardwood sawlogs, our mix includes hardwood fiber logs for pulp and oriented strand board applications. Hardwood pulpwood is a significant market in the Northern region and we have long-term supply agreements, primarily at market rates, for nearly 95 percent of our hardwood pulp production.

We also grow softwood logs that supply our lumber and plywood mills and other customers. Our competitive advantages include a merchandising program to capture the value of the premium hardwood logs.

Regeneration is predominantly natural, augmented by planting where appropriate.

Northern log sales volume internally. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest approximately 1 percent of our acreage each year in the North.

Canada — Licensed Forestlands

We manage forestlands in Canada under long-term licenses from the provincial governments to secure volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. The provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through Annual Allowable Cuts (AAC), which are updated every 10 years. As of December 31, 2020, our AAC by province was:

 

•

Alberta — 2,221 thousand tons,

•

British Columbia — 547 thousand tons,

•

Ontario — 154 thousand tons and

•

Saskatchewan — 633 thousand tons.

 

When the volume is harvested, we pay the province for that volume at stumpage rates set by the government. The harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost (stumpage plus harvest, haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties). Any profit from harvesting the log through converting to finished products is recognized at the respective mill in our Wood Products segment.

HOW MUCH WE HARVEST

Our fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of long-term economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets. This is accomplished by ensuring annual harvest schedules target financially mature timber and reforestation activities align with the growing of timber through its life cycle to financial maturity.

Log Sales Volume

Our sales volume includes fee timber as well as logs purchased in the open market.

Our log sales volumes to unaffiliated customers over the last two years were:

 

•

24,332 thousand tons in 2020 and

•

26,963 thousand tons in 2019.

 

We sell three grades of logs — domestic grade, domestic fiber and export. Factors that may affect log sales in each of these categories include:

 

•

domestic grade log sales — lumber usage, primarily for housing starts and repair and remodel activity, the needs of our own mills and the availability of logs from both outside markets and our own timberlands;

•

domestic fiber log sales — demand for wood chips by pulp mills, containerboard mills, pellet mills and oriented strand board mills and

•

export log sales — the level of housing starts in Japan and construction in China, as well as availability of logs from other countries, particularly for China.

Western logs are primarily transacted in thousand board feet (MBF) but are converted to ton equivalents for external reporting purposes.

(2)

In November 2019, we sold our Michigan timberlands and in March 2020, we sold our Montana timberlands. Refer to Note 4: Timberland Acquisitions and Divestitures for further information on these divestitures.

Other delivered logs included sales from timberlands managed for the Twin Creeks Venture. Our management agreement for the Twin Creeks Venture began in April 2016 and terminated in December 2017.

 

Log Prices

Domestic and export grade logs are sold at market prices to unaffiliated customers or our internal mills. The majority of our log sales to unaffiliated customers involve sales to domestic sawmills and the export market. Log prices in the following tables are on a delivered (mill) basis.

Five-Year Summary of Export Log Prices (#2 Sawlog Bark On — $/MBF)



 

Log prices are affected by the supply of and demand for grade and fiber logs. Export log prices are particularly affected by the Japanese housing market, Chinese construction activity and the availability of logs.

WHERE WE’RE HEADED

Our competitive strategies include:

 

•

continuing to capitalize on our scale of operations, silviculture and supply chain expertise and sustainability practices;

•

improving cash flow through operational excellence initiatives including merchandising for value, harvest and transportation efficiencies as well as focused silviculture investments to improve forest productivity;

•

leveraging our export and domestic market access, infrastructure and strong customer relationships;

•

increasing our recreational lease revenue and

•

continuing to maximize the value of our timberlands portfolio by managing the acres to achieve the highest and best use.

 

 

REAL ESTATE, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES

Our Real Estate & ENR segment maximizes the value of our timberland ownership through application of our asset value optimization (AVO) process and captures the full value of surface and subsurface assets, such as construction materials, industrial minerals, oil, natural gas and wind and solar resources.

WHAT WE DO

Real Estate

Properties that exhibit higher use value than commercial timberlands are monetized by our Real Estate business over time. We analyze our existing U.S. timberland holdings using a process we call AVO. We start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market. The assessment includes demographics, infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to realize a premium value to commercial timberland. Attributes can evolve over time, and accordingly, the assignment of value and opportunity can change. We continually revisit our AVO assessment for all our timberland acres.

We expect to sell these properties for recreational, conservation, commercial or residential purposes over time. We will entitle a small amount of acres to support development. Development, outside of entitlement activities, is typically performed by third parties. Some of our real estate activities are conducted through our TRSs.

Occasionally, we sell a small amount of timberlands acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence and capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands. These transactions will vary based on factors including the locations and physical characteristics of the timberlands.

The volume of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including the general state of the economy, demand in local real estate markets, the ability of buyers to obtain financing, the number of competing properties listed for sale, the seasonal nature of sales (particularly in the northern states), the plans of adjacent landowners, our expectation of future price appreciation, the timing of harvesting activities and the availability of government and not-for-profit funding. In any period, the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold.

Energy and Natural Resources

We focus on maximizing potential opportunities for construction materials, industrial minerals, renewable energy (including wind and solar energy), oil, natural gas, rights of way easements on our timberlands portfolio and retained mineral interests.

As the owner of mineral rights and interests, we typically do not invest in development or operations but, instead, enter into contracts with operators granting them the rights to explore and sell energy and natural resources produced from our property in exchange for rents and royalties.

We generally reserve mineral rights when selling timberlands acreage. Some Energy and Natural Resources activities are conducted through our TRSs.

Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources Sources of Revenue

 

SOURCES

ACTIVITIES

Real Estate

• Select timberland tracts are sold for recreational, conservation, commercial or residential purposes.

Energy and Natural Resources

• Rights are granted to explore, extract and sell construction aggregates (rock, sand and gravel), industrial materials and oil and natural gas.

• Ground leases and easements are granted to wind and solar developers to generate renewable electricity from our timberlands.

• Rights are granted to access and utilize timberland acreage for communications, pipeline, powerline and transportation rights of way.

 

WHERE WE DO IT

Our Real Estate business identifies opportunities to realize premium value for our U.S. owned timberland acreage.

The majority of our Energy and Natural Resources revenue sources are located in Oregon, Washington, South Carolina and Georgia (construction material royalties); as well as the Gulf South and West Virginia (oil and natural gas royalties).

Wood Products Prices

Prices for commodity wood products — structural lumber, oriented strand board and softwood plywood — increased significantly in 2020 from 2019.

In general, the following factors influence sales realizations for wood products:

 

•

Demand for wood products used in residential and multi-family construction and the repair and remodel of existing homes affects prices. Residential and multi-family construction is influenced by factors such as population growth and other demographics, availability of labor and lots, the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels, and the supply and pricing of existing homes on the market. Repair and remodel activity is affected by the size and age of existing housing inventory and access to home equity financing and other credit.

•

The supply of commodity building products such as structural lumber, oriented strand board and softwood plywood affects prices. A number of factors can influence supply, including changes in production capacity and utilization rates, weather, raw material supply and availability of transportation.

NATURAL RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

We are subject to a multitude of laws and regulations in the operation of our businesses. We also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality, including the protection of wildlife and water quality. Changes in law and regulation, or certification standards, can significantly affect our business.

REGULATIONS AFFECTING FORESTRY PRACTICES

In the United States, regulations established by federal, state and local government agencies to protect water quality, wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands. Forest practice laws and regulations that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include:

 

•

limits on the size of clearcuts,

•

requirements that some timber be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat,

•

regulations regarding construction and maintenance of forest roads,

•

rules requiring reforestation following timber harvest,

•

regulations on the use of pesticides and herbicides and

•

various related permit programs.

 

Each state in which we own timberlands has developed best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats. Additional and more stringent regulations may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve water-quality standards under the federal Clean Water Act, protect fish and wildlife habitats, human health, or achieve other public policy objectives.

In Canada, our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces. All forest operations in Canada are subject to:

 

•

forest practices and environmental regulations and

•

license requirements established by contract between us and the relevant province designed to:

 

-  

protect environmental values and

 

-  

encourage other stewardship values.

In Canada, 21 member companies of the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), including Weyerhaeuser’s Canadian subsidiary, announced in May 2010 the signing of a Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA) with nine environmental organizations. The CBFA applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to FPAC members and, when fully implemented, was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of Canada’s boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk, in particular, woodland caribou. While the CBFA mandate came to an end in 2017, CBFA signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of aboriginal and local communities in advancing the goals of the CBFA.

ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTIONS

In the United States, a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) or similar state laws, including but not limited to:

 

•

the northern spotted owl, the marbled murrelet, a number of salmon species, bull trout and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest;

•

several freshwater mussel and sturgeon species and

•

the red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise, dusky gopher frog, American burying beetle and Northern long-eared bat in the South or Southeast.

Additional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies. In addition, significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate "critical habitat" for ESA-listed species, and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time. Such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options. Restrictions on timber harvests can result from:

 

•

federal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species;

•

regulatory actions by federal or state agencies to protect these species and their habitat and

•

citizen suits under the ESA.

Such actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general. To date, we do not believe that these measures have had, and we do not believe that in 2021 they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of U.S. competitors.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2020 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 21

Table of Contents

 

In Canada:

 

•

The federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) requires protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for their critical habitat. Pursuant to SARA, Environment Canada continues to identify and assess species deemed to be at risk and their critical habitat.

•

In October 2012, the Canadian Minister of the Environment released a strategy for the recovery of the boreal population of woodland caribou under the SARA. The population and distribution objectives for boreal caribou across Canada are to (1) maintain the current status of existing, self-sustaining local caribou populations and (2) stabilize and achieve self-sustaining status for non-self-sustaining local caribou populations. Critical habitat for boreal caribou is identified for all boreal caribou ranges, except for northern Saskatchewan’s Boreal Shield range (SK1) where additional information is required for that population. Species assessment and recovery plans are developed in consultation with aboriginal communities and stakeholders.

•

In 2017, the Provinces were required to update the federal government on any progress associated with their draft caribou range plans. These draft plans will be further evaluated in 2021, and any additional information on potential effects to forest harvest operations will be released.

The identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may, over time, result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in Canada. To date, we do not believe that these Canadian measures have had, and we do not believe that in 2021 they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of Canadian competitors.

FOREST CERTIFICATION STANDARDS

We operate in North America under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI). This is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values. SFI is an independent standard, overseen by a governing board consisting of:

 

•

conservation organizations,

•

academia,

•

the forest industry and

•

large and small forest landowners.

Ongoing compliance with SFI may result in some increases in our operating costs and reduction of our timber harvests in some areas. There is also competition from other private certification systems, primarily the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system. Certain features of the FSC system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management. Because of the considerable variation in FSC standards, and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied, if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from other than SFI-certified forests, we could incur substantial additional costs for operations and be required to reduce harvest levels.

WHAT THESE REGULATIONS AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS MEAN TO US

The regulatory and non-regulatory forest management programs described above have:

 

•

increased our operating costs;

•

resulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands;

•

contributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand;

•

sometimes made it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets, extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances and

•

potentially encouraged further reductions in the use of, or substitution of other products for, lumber, oriented strand board, engineered

wood products and plywood.

We believe that these regulations and programs have not had, and in 2021 will not have, a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the United States or Canada. However, these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future. We expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands. We also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods.

CANADIAN ABORIGINAL RIGHTS

Many of the Canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common-law rights of aboriginal peoples of Canada. Most of British Columbia (B.C.) is not covered by treaties, and as a result the claims of B.C.’s aboriginal peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot’in Nation holds aboriginal title to approximately 1,900 square kilometers in B.C., the first time the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by aboriginal peoples. Many aboriginal groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of B.C., other provinces and Canada.

Final or interim resolution of claims brought by aboriginal groups can be expected to result in:

 

•

additional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber,

•

potential increase in operating costs and

•

effect on timber supply and prices in Canada.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2020 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 22

Table of Contents

 

 

We believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2021, although they may have such an effect in the future.

POLLUTION-CONTROL REGULATIONS

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local pollution control laws and regulations.

These laws and regulations, as well as market demands, impose controls with regard to:

 

•

air, water and land;

•

solid and hazardous waste management;

•

waste disposal;

•

remediation of contaminated sites and

•

the chemical content of some of our products.

Compliance with these laws, regulations and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. We cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws, regulations and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects.

Our capital projects typically are designed to:

 

•

enhance safety,

•

extend the life of a facility,

•

lower costs and improve efficiency,

•

improve reliability,

•

increase capacity,

•

facilitate raw material changes and handling requirements,

•

increase the economic value of assets or products and

•

comply with regulatory standards.

 

ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP

We are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites. Of these sites:

 

•

we may have the sole obligation to remediate,

•

we may share that obligation with one or more parties,

•

several parties may have joint and several obligations to remediate and

•

we may have been named as a potentially responsible party for contaminated sites, including those designated as U.S. Superfund sites.

Our liability with respect to these various sites ranges from insignificant to substantial. The amount of liability depends on the:

 

•

quantity, toxicity and nature of materials at the site and

•

number and economic viability of the other responsible parties.

We spent approximately $8 million in 2020 and expect to spend approximately $6 million in 2021 on environmental remediation of these sites.

It is our policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when we:

 

•

determine it is probable that such an obligation exists and

•

can reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation.

Based on currently available information and analysis, we believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accruals of $57 million by up to $121 million. This estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue. The estimate of the upper range also relies on assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.

REGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN THE U.S.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations for air emissions from:

 

•

wood products facilities and

•

industrial boilers.

These regulations cover:

 

•

hazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT) and

•

controls and/or monitoring for pollutants that contribute to smog, haze and more recently, greenhouse gases.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2020 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 23

Table of Contents

 

 

The EPA has issued several rules relating to MACT standards and the emission of greenhouse gases from various energy-producing sources. Several court decisions have made the extent of applicability of these rules uncertain. Depending on the final outcomes of these decisions, these regulatory programs could affect our operations by increasing the cost of purchasing electricity or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate. The EPA is also expected to issue rules relating to biomass emissions, which is a significant source of energy at our mills. The effect of these existing and future emissions regulations, as well as related court decisions, on our operations remains uncertain. We continue to track and evaluate the litigation and regulatory developments but are not able to predict whether the regulations, when complete and implemented, will have a material effect on our operations.

To address concerns about greenhouse gases as a pollutant, we:

 

•

closely monitor legislative, regulatory and scientific developments pertaining to climate change;

•

adopted in 2006, as part of the company's sustainability program, a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2020 compared with our emissions in 2000, assuming a comparable portfolio and regulations;

•

determined to achieve this goal by increasing energy efficiency and using more greenhouse gas-neutral, biomass fuels instead of fossil fuels and

•

reduced greenhouse gas emissions by over 50 percent considering changes in the asset portfolio according to 2018 data, compared to our 2000 baseline.

Additional factors that could affect regulation of greenhouse gas emissions in the future include:

 

•

policy proposals by federal or state governments regarding regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,

•

Congressional legislation regulating or taxing greenhouse gas emissions within the next several years and

•

establishment of a multistate or federal greenhouse gas emissions reduction trading system with potentially significant implications for all U.S. businesses.

 

We believe these developments have not had, and in 2021 will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from actual climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not anticipate any disruptions to our planned operations.

REGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN CANADA

Our wood products facilities are regulated in Canada under provincial air quality rules. The Canadian federal government has also proposed an air quality management system (AQMS) as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in Canada to go along with existing provincial air quality regulations. The AQMS includes:

 

•

ambient air quality standards for outdoor air quality management across the country;

•

a framework for air zone air management within provinces and territories that targets specific sources of air emissions;

•

regional airsheds that facilitate coordinated action across borders;

•

industrial sector-based emission requirements that set a national base level of performance for major industries in Canada and

•

improved intergovernmental collaboration to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.

 

In addition to these existing and proposed regulations, Environment and Climate Change Canada, a Canadian federal agency, released the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, a "Greenhouse Gas Emission Framework." The framework put in place a national, sector-based greenhouse gas reduction program applicable to a number of industries, including ours.

All Canadian provincial governments:

 

•

have greenhouse gas reporting requirements,

•

are working on reduction strategies and

•

together with the Canadian federal government, are considering new or revised emission standards.

Along with clean air regulations, British Columbia, a province in which we operate, has adopted a carbon tax and Alberta, where we also have operations, has a mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction regulation.

Although these and related regulations and measures have not had, and we do not expect in 2021 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future.

REGULATION OF WATER IN THE U.S.

Our operations are regulated under the Clean Water Act, which regulates the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the U.S. This generally means obtaining permits for certain of our silviculture activities and abiding by applicable restrictions. Federal agency rulemaking and related litigation under the act has led to increased jurisdiction of the act by expanding the definition of waterways subject to the act’s regulation. This, in turn, has increased the number of required federal and state permits in some areas of our operations as it relates to the application of pesticides and herbicides on timberlands, which has increased operating costs. Pending and future federal and state rulemaking, and judicial challenges thereto, could make application of the Clean Water Act, as well as comparable state laws, more or less costly to Weyerhaeuser, and we are not able to predict the final resolution of these matters. Although this and related regulations have not had, and we do not expect in 2021 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future.

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2020 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 24

Table of Contents

 

REGULATION OF WATER IN CANADA

Changes to the Canadian Federal Fisheries Act have moved the focus of that legislation from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increased penalties. We expect further changes to these regulations, but we cannot predict the scope or potential effect, if any, on our operations. Although this and related Canadian regulations have not had, and we do not expect in 2021 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future.

POTENTIAL CHANGES IN POLLUTION REGULATION

State governments in the U.S. continue to promulgate total maximum daily load (TMDL) requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or EPA water quality standards. State TMDL requirements may set:

 

•

limits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water; or

•

additional requirements, such as best management practices for nonpoint sources, including timberland operations, to reduce the amounts of pollutants.

 

Moreover, some states, including at least two in which we operate, have adopted or have introduced legislation to adopt human-health-based water quality standards. These requirements may alter or introduce restrictions on some of our silviculture activities, notably the application of pesticides and herbicides to our timberlands in some areas. In Canada, various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use, quality and management. Recent areas of focus include water allocation, regional watershed protection, protection of drinking water, water pricing and a national water quality index.

Although these developments have not had, and we do not expect in 2021 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future.

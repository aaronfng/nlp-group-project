PART I


ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Vornado is a fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 92.8% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2020.
We currently own all or portions of: 
New York:
•20.6 million square feet of Manhattan office space in 33 properties;
•2.7 million square feet of Manhattan street retail space in 65 properties;
•1,989 units in 10 Manhattan residential properties;
•The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33rd Street in the heart of the Penn District (closed since April 1, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic);
•A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building;
•Signage throughout the Penn District and Times Square; and
•Building Maintenance Services LLC ("BMS"), a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning and security services for our buildings and third parties.
Other Real Estate and Investments:

•Other real estate and investments.
OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY
Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:
•maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;
•investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;
•acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;
•developing and redeveloping properties to increase returns and maximize value; and
•investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.
We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds and proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We completed the following sale transactions during 2020:
•$1.05 billion net proceeds from the sale of 35 condominium units at 220 Central Park South ("220 CPS"); and

DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES
220 Central Park South
We are completing construction of a residential condominium tower containing 397,000 salable square feet at 220 CPS. The development cost of this project (exclusive of land cost) is estimated to be approximately $1.480 billion, of which $1.455 billion has been expended as of December 31, 2020.
Penn District
Farley
Our 95% joint venture (5% is owned by the Related Companies ("Related")) is developing Farley Office and Retail, which will include approximately 844,000 rentable square feet of commercial space, comprised of approximately 730,000 square feet of office space and approximately 114,000 square feet of restaurant and retail space. The total development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $1,120,000,000, an increase of $90,000,000, which is primarily due to higher projected tenant improvement allowances for the office, restaurant and retail space. As of December 31, 2020, $791,994,000 has been expended, which has been reduced by $88,000,000 of historic tax credit investor contributions (at our share).
The joint venture entered into a development agreement with Empire State Development (“ESD”), an entity of New York State, to build the adjacent Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture's obligations. The joint venture entered into a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders ("Skanska") pursuant to which they built the Moynihan Train Hall on the joint venture's behalf. Skanska substantially completed construction as of December 31, 2020, thereby fulfilling this obligation to ESD. The joint venture, which we consolidate on our consolidated balance sheets, leased the entire property during the construction period and pursuant to ASC 842-40-55, was required to recognize all development expenditures for Moynihan Train Hall. Accordingly, the development expenditures funded by governmental agencies were presented as “Moynihan Train Hall development expenditures” with a corresponding obligation recorded to “Moynihan Train Hall Obligation” on our consolidated balance sheets. On December 31, 2020, upon substantial completion of Moynihan Train Hall, the portions of the property not pertaining to the joint venture's commercial space were severed from its lease with ESD and we removed the "Moynihan Train Hall development expenditures" and the offsetting “Moynihan Train Hall obligation” from our consolidated balance sheets.
PENN1
We are redeveloping PENN1, a 2,545,000 square foot office building located on 34th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the “MTA”) to oversee the redevelopment of the Long Island Rail Road Concourse at Penn Station (the "Concourse"), within the footprint of PENN1. Skanska USA Civil Northeast, Inc. will perform the redevelopment under a fixed price contract for $396,000,000 which is being funded by the MTA. In connection with the redevelopment, we entered into an agreement with the MTA which will result in the widening of the Concourse to relieve overcrowding and our trading of 15,000 square feet of back of house space for 22,000 square feet of retail frontage space. The total development cost of our PENN1 project is estimated to be $450,000,000, an increase of $125,000,000, which is primarily due to the addition of the Concourse retail redevelopment project and sustainability initiatives, including the installation of triple pane high energy performance windows and the implementation of an electrification program to allow PENN1 to access more clean renewable electricity. As of December 31, 2020, $167,894,000 has been expended.
PENN2
We are redeveloping PENN2, a 1,795,000 square foot (as expanded) office building, located on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $750,000,000, of which $91,219,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2020.
We are also making districtwide improvements within the Penn District. The development cost of these improvements is estimated to be $100,000,000, of which $19,618,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2020.
Other
We are redeveloping a 78,000 square foot Class A office building at 345 Montgomery Street, a part of our 555 California Street complex in San Francisco (70.0% interest) located at the corner of California and Pine Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $66,000,000, of which our share is $46,000,000. As of December 31, 2020, $55,261,000 has been expended, of which our share is $38,683,000.
We are redeveloping a 165,000 square foot office building at 825 Seventh Avenue, located at the corner of 53rd Street and Seventh Avenue (50.0% interest). The redevelopment cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $30,000,000, of which our share is $15,000,000. As of December 31, 2020, $26,508,000 has been expended, of which our share is $13,254,000.
We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan including, in particular, the Penn District.
There can be no assurance that the above projects will be completed, completed on schedule or within budget.

COMPETITION
We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.
SEGMENT DATA
We operate in the following reportable segments: New York and Other. Financial information related to these reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is set forth in Note 24 – Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
SEASONALITY 
Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The New York segment has historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. 
TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF REVENUES 
None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
CERTAIN ACTIVITIES 
We do not base our acquisitions and investments on specific allocations by type of property. We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold or otherwise disposed of when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. Generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by Vornado’s Board of Trustees without the vote of our shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders. 
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately 2,899 employees, consisting of (i) 246 corporate staff; (ii) 2,568 employees of the New York segment comprised of 1,997 employees of Building Maintenance Services LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary, which provides cleaning, security and engineering services primarily to our New York properties, 422 employees at the Hotel Pennsylvania and 149 employees in leasing and property management; and (iii) 85 employees of theMART. The foregoing does not include employees of partially owned entities. 
We continue to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit. We value our employees as our greatest asset, and to foster their talent and growth, we provide training and education, promote career and personal development, and encourage innovation and engagement.

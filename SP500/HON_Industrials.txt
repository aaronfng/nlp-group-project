EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Despite a challenging 2020, we continued to deliver on our financial commitments and create long-term shareowner value. Although sales declined 11% to $32.6 billion, our differentiated solutions delivered double-digit sales growth in the defense and space, warehouse automation, PPE and recurring connected software businesses. We adapted to apply Honeywell's capabilities toward addressing the COVID-19 challenges of our customers around the world. Our execution through the downturn demonstrated our ability to move quickly and decisively to reduce fixed costs, ensure liquidity, invest in growth, and position ourselves for recovery, while at the same time, remaining focused on our three transformation initiatives – Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital, and Integrated Supply Chain.
We maintained our commitment to create long-term shareowner value and, despite the downturn, we deployed $7.5 billion to capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and mergers and acquisitions, which was approximately $1.3 billion in excess of our operating cash flow for the year. Further, we improved our cash and short-term investments by $4.8 billion, which provided stability as well as opportunity for investment during challenging times.
As we look forward, we intend to continue deploying capital to high-return opportunities, including software and services with recurring revenue streams, positioning our business for future growth. Orders for our warehouse automation, PPE, and healthy building solutions remain strong, and we carry a robust backlog of $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. We are a leading software-industrial company committed to introducing state of the art technology solutions to improve efficiency, productivity and safety in high growth businesses in broad-based, attractive industrial end markets.

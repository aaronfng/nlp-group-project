ABOUT PFIZER

Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942.

Most of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of our products, principally biopharmaceutical products, and to a lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us. We believe that our medicines and vaccines provide significant value for healthcare providers and patients, through improved treatment of diseases, improvements in health, wellness and productivity as well as by reducing other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization. We seek to enhance the value of our medicines and vaccines and actively engage in dialogues about how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. We seek to maximize patient access and evaluate our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers to minimize adverse impact on our revenues within the current legal and pricing structures.

We are committed to fulfilling our purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our colleagues and shareholders. Pfizer’s growth strategy is driven by five “Bold Moves” that help us deliver breakthroughs for patients and create value for shareholders and other stakeholders:

1.Unleash the power of our people;
2.Deliver first-in-class science;
3.Transform our go-to-market model;
4.Win the digital race in pharma; and
5.Lead the conversation.

We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, as well as through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will advance our business.

Following (i) the recent spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business (which was our global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business) with Mylan, which created a new global pharmaceutical company, Viatris, in November 2020 and (ii) the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019, we saw the culmination of Pfizer’s transformation into a more focused, innovative science-based biopharmaceutical products business.

Our significant recent business development activities in 2020 include: (i) the April 2020 agreement with BioNTech to develop, manufacture and commercialize an mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program, BNT162, aimed at preventing COVID-19, (ii) the June 2020 agreement to co-develop and commercialize Valneva’s Lyme disease vaccine candidate, VLA15, (iii) the September 2020 entry into a strategic collaboration with CStone to develop and commercialize a PD-L1 antibody, sugemalimab, and to bring additional oncology assets to China, (iv) the November 2020 spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan, and (v) the December 2020 entry into a collaboration with Myovant to jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in advanced prostate cancer and women’s health in the U.S. and Canada. For a further discussion of our strategy and our business development initiatives, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A and Note 2.

In 2020, our business, operations and financial condition and results were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To confront the public health challenge posed by the pandemic, we have made some important advances, including, among others, the development of a vaccine to help prevent COVID-19. For additional information, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—COVID-19 Pandemic section within MD&A and the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Development, Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products and —COVID-19 Pandemic sections in this Form 10-K.
COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS

In 2020, we managed our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two businesses—Biopharma, and, through November 16, 2020, Upjohn, each led by a single manager.

On November 16, 2020, we completed the spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan. Following the combination, we now operate as a focused innovative biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of biopharmaceutical products worldwide. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, the financial results of the Upjohn Business are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Prior-period information has been restated to reflect our current organizational structure following the separation of the Upjohn Business. In 2019, Consumer Healthcare, which was our OTC medicines business, was

COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION

We use collaboration and/or co-promotion arrangements to enhance our development, R&D, sales and distribution of certain biopharmaceutical products, which include, among others, the following:
•Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (BNT162b2) is an mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent COVID-19 which is being jointly developed and commercialized with BioNTech. Pfizer and BioNTech will equally share the costs of development for the BNT162 program. BNT162b2 has now been granted a CMA, EUA or temporary authorization in more than 50 countries worldwide. We will also share gross profits equally from commercialization of BNT162b2 and are working jointly with BioNTech in our respective territories to commercialize the vaccine worldwide (excluding China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan), subject to regulatory authorizations or approvals market by market. For discussion on BNT162b2, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—COVID-19 Pandemic section within MD&A.
•Eliquis (apixaban) is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market and was jointly developed and commercialized with BMS as an alternative treatment option to warfarin in appropriate patients. We fund between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study, and profits and losses are shared equally except in certain countries where we commercialize Eliquis and pay a percentage of net sales to BMS. In certain smaller markets we have full commercialization rights and BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers.
•Xtandi (enzalutamide) is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas. We share equally in the gross profits and losses related to U.S. net sales and also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we share certain development and other collaboration expenses. For international net sales we receive royalties based on a tiered percentage.
•Bavencio (avelumab) is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody that is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. We jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs and split profits equally related to net sales generated from any products containing avelumab.
•Orgovyx (relugolix) is an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer that is being developed and commercialized with Myovant. The companies are also collaborating on relugolix combination tablet (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in women’s health. The companies will equally share profits and allowable expenses in the U.S. and Canada for Orgovyx and the relugolix combination tablet, with Myovant bearing our share of allowable expenses up to a maximum of $100 million in 2021 and up to a maximum of $50 million in 2022. Myovant will remain responsible for regulatory interactions and drug supply and continue to lead clinical development for the relugolix combination tablet.

Revenues associated with these arrangements are included in Alliance revenues (except in certain markets where we have direct sales and except for the majority of revenues for BNT162b2, which are included as direct product revenues). In addition, we have collaboration arrangements for the development and commercialization of certain pipeline products that are in development stage, including, among others, with Lilly to jointly develop and globally commercialize tanezumab for the treatment of osteoarthritis pain and cancer pain, under which the companies share equally the ongoing development costs and, if successful, will co-commercialize and share equally in profits and certain expenses in the U.S., while Pfizer will be responsible for commercialization activities and costs outside the U.S., with Lilly having the right to

receive certain tiered royalties outside the U.S. For further discussion of collaboration and co-promotion agreements, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Collaborations and Other Relationships with Third Parties section in this Form 10-K and Notes 2 and 17.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

R&D is at the heart of fulfilling our purpose to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that may be the most impactful for patients. The discovery and development of drugs and biological products are time consuming, costly and unpredictable. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications.

Our R&D Priorities and Strategy. Our R&D priorities include:
•delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where we have a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;
•advancing our capabilities that can position us for long-term R&D leadership; and
•advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.

To that end, our R&D primarily focuses on our main therapeutic areas.

While a significant portion of our R&D is internal, we also seek promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by others to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines. We do so by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreements with universities, biotechnology companies and other firms as well as through acquisitions and investments. We also have arrangements with third parties that fund a portion of the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive future payments, such as milestone-based, revenue sharing, or profit-sharing payments or royalties. These collaboration, alliance, license and funding agreements and investments allow us to share knowledge, risk and cost. They also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and in-licensed or acquired products. For information on certain of these collaborations, alliances, license and funding arrangements and investments, see Note 2.

Our R&D Operations. In 2020, we continued to strengthen our global R&D operations and pursue strategies to improve R&D productivity to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&D activity is conducted through various platform functions that operate in parallel within our global operations, including the following:
•WRDM. Research units are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept) and are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. We can rapidly redeploy resources within a research unit and between various projects to leverage, as necessary, common skills, expertise or focus.
•GPD. GPD is a unified center for clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational execution of clinical trials for both early-stage assets in the WRDM portfolio as well as late-stage assets in our portfolio.
•Science-based platform-services organizations. These organizations provide technical expertise and other services to various R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions (which are part of our WRDM organization) such as Pharmaceutical Sciences and Medicine Design. These organizations allow us to react more quickly and effectively to evolving needs by sharing resources among projects, candidates and targets across therapeutic areas and phases of development. Another platform-service organization is the Worldwide Medical and Safety (WMS) group, which includes worldwide safety surveillance, medical information and the Chief Medical Office. The WMS group provides patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities with complete and up-to-date information about the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer’s R&D programs and marketed products so they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use our products.

We manage R&D operations on a total-company basis through our platform functions described above. Specifically, the Portfolio Strategy & Investment committee, comprised of senior executives, is accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRDM, GPD and R&D projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative R&D portfolio. We believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility.
We do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage our R&D operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that any prior-period information about R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.

In 2020, the R&D organization within Upjohn supported the off-patent branded and generic established medicines and managed its resources separately from the WRDM and GPD organizations. Following the spin-off and combination of the Upjohn Business with Mylan to create Viatris, we have agreed to provide certain transition services to Viatris including support for R&D, pharmacovigilance and safety surveillance.

Our R&D Pipeline. The process of drug and biological product discovery from initiation through development and to potential regulatory approval is lengthy and can take more than ten years. As of February 2, 2021, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D:
pfe-20201231_g2.jpg
Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While our drug candidates may or may not receive regulatory approval, new candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Product Developments section within MD&A. For information on the risks associated with R&D, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Research and Development section of this Form 10-K.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

Our operations are conducted globally, and we sell our products in over 125 countries. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets. Urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets provide potential growth opportunities for our products.

Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $20.2 billion accounted for 48% of our total revenues in 2020. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of 8, 10 and 10 countries outside the U.S. in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. By total revenues, China and Japan are our two largest national markets outside the U.S. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues by Geography section within MD&A and the table captioned Geographic Information in Note 17A.
pfe-20201231_g3.jpg
Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global Operations and Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections in this Form 10-K.
SALES AND MARKETING

Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies. In the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines products directly to the federal government, CDC, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies and integrated delivery networks. Outside the U.S., we primarily sell our vaccines to government and non-government institutions. A portion of our government contracts are subject to renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the discretion of a government entity. We seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and PBM formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas. For information on our largest biopharmaceutical wholesalers, see Note 17B.


								
Pfizer Inc.	2020 Form 10-K

We promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues and our patient assistance programs.
PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

Patents. We own or license a number of patents covering pharmaceutical and other products, their uses, formulations, and product manufacturing processes.

Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The scope of protection afforded by a patent can vary from country to country and depends on the patent type, the scope of its patent claims and the availability of legal remedies. Patent term extensions (PTE) may be available in some countries to compensate for a loss of patent term due to delay in a product’s approval due to the regulatory requirements. One of the primary considerations in limiting our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products, although international and U.S. free trade agreements have included some improved global protection of intellectual property rights. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this Form 10-K.

In various markets, a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drugs upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, in general, the period will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval.

Based on current sales, and considering the competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires, are as follows:

(1)Unless otherwise indicated, the years pertain to the basic product patent expiration, including granted PTEs, supplementary protection certificates (SPC) or pediatric exclusivity periods. SPCs are included when granted in three out of five major European markets (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the U.K.). Noted in parentheses is the projected year of expiry of the earliest pending patent term extension in the U.S. or Japan and/or SPC application in Europe, the term of which, if granted, may be shorter than originally requested due to a number of factors. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products which may or may not protect our drug from generic or biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.
(2)The basic product patent for Chantix in the U.S. expired in November 2020.
(3)Xeljanz Europe expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity.
(4)The Europe patent that covers the combination of the 13 serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 was revoked following an opposition and has now been withdrawn. There are other Europe patents and pending applications covering the formulation, various aspects of the manufacturing process, and the combination of serotype conjugates of Prevenar 13 that remain in force.
(5)Eliquis was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with BMS. For Eliquis in the U.S., two patents listed in the FDA Orange Book, the composition of matter patent claiming apixaban specifically and a formulation patent, were challenged by numerous generic companies and are the subject of patent infringement litigation. Prior to the August 2020 ruling referenced in the following sentence, we and BMS settled with a number of these generic companies (settled generic companies) while continuing to litigate against three remaining generic companies (remaining generic companies). In August 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware decided that the two challenged Eliquis patents are both valid and infringed by the remaining generic companies. The remaining generic companies have appealed the Delaware court decision and the final decision in this case could determine when generic versions of Eliquis will come on the market.
While we cannot predict the outcome of this pending litigation, these are the alternatives that might occur: (a) If the district court’s decision is upheld in the current appeal with respect to both patents, under the terms of previously executed settlement agreements with the settled generic companies, the permitted date of launch for the settled generic companies under these patents is April 1, 2028; (b) if the formulation patent is held invalid or not infringed in the current appeal, the settled generic companies and the remaining generic companies would be permitted to launch on November 21, 2026; or (c) if both patents are held invalid or not infringed in the current appeal, the settled generic companies and the remaining generic companies could launch products immediately upon such an adverse decision.
In addition, both patents may be subject to subsequent challenges by parties other than the remaining generic companies. If this were to occur, depending on the outcome of the subsequent challenge, the potential launch by generic companies, including challengers, if successful, could occur on timelines similar to those discussed above.

Refer to Note 16A1 for more information.
(6)Xtandi is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Astellas, which has exclusive commercialization rights for Xtandi outside the U.S. Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international Xtandi net sales.
(7)Besponsa Japan expiry is provided by regulatory exclusivity.
(8)We have exclusive rights to Braftovi and Mektovi in the U.S. The Pierre Fabre Group has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Europe and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has exclusive rights to commercialize both products in Japan. We receive royalties from The Pierre Fabre Group and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. on sales of Braftovi and Mektovi outside the U.S.
(9)Mektovi U.S. expiry is provided by a method of use patent.
(10)Bavencio is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA.

The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. Once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge, we typically lose exclusivity on these products, and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell them for a lower price. The date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, when generic or biosimilar competition does commence, the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products, often in a very short period of time. Also, if one of our product-related patents is found to be invalid by judicial, court or regulatory or administrative proceedings, generic or biosimilar products could be introduced, resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products.

We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Intellectual Property Protection, —Third Party Intellectual Property Claims and —Competitive Products sections in this Form 10-K and Note 16A1.

Losses of Product Exclusivity. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years. The basic product patent for Chantix in the U.S. expired on November 10, 2020. Also, the basic product patent for Sutent in the U.S. will expire in August 2021. For additional information on the impact of LOEs on our revenues, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income––Revenues––Selected Product Discussion section within MD&A.

Trademarks. Our products are sold under brand-name and logo trademarks and trade dress. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms and protection is provided in some countries for as long as the mark is used while in others, for as long as it is registered. Protecting our trademarks is of material importance to Pfizer.
COMPETITION

Our business is conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use and cost. Though the means of competition vary among our products, demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success.

We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products. These competitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers. Our competitors also may devote substantial funds and resources to R&D and their successful R&D could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&D expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration.

To address competitive trends we continually emphasize innovation, which is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our business development transactions, both designed to result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research continues even after drug approval as we seek to further demonstrate the value of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We educate patients, physicians, payers and global health authorities on the benefits and risks of our medicines, and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical functions, including to accurately and ethically launch and market our products to our customers.

Operating conditions have also shifted as a result of increased global competitive pressures, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices in an effort to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we have taken an industry-leading role in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals and medical education grants. We also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through our support for better healthcare solutions.

Our vaccines may face competition from the introduction of alternative vaccines or “next-generation” vaccines prior to or after the expiration of their patents, which may adversely affect our future results.

Our biosimilars compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. We sell biosimilars of certain inflammation & immunology and oncology biologic medicines. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-market” or early market position for our biosimilars to provide customers a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide us with higher levels of sales and profitability until other competitors enter the market.


								
Pfizer Inc.	2020 Form 10-K

Generic Products. Generic pharmaceutical manufacturers pose one of the biggest competitive challenges to our branded small molecule products because they can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less. Several competitors regularly challenge our product patents before their expiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product. In China, for example, we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2021 and beyond, which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products. In addition, generic versions of competitors’ branded products may also compete with our products.

MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S., and U.S. laws generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs for brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution.

Biosimilars. Certain of our biologic products, including Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), already face, or may face in the future, competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to innovative biologic medicines. In the U.S., biosimilars referencing innovative biologic products are approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act.
PRICING PRESSURES AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS

Pricing Pressures. Pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continue to be significant. Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. Many employers have adopted high deductible health plans, which can increase out-of-pocket costs for medicines. This trend is likely to continue. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. Pricing pressures also may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.

Longer term, we foresee a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. At the same time, these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions.

We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and help ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system. In addition, in response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-development process to better understand how these entities value our compounds and products. Further, we seek to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs.

For information on government pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Pricing and Reimbursement sections in this Form 10-K.

Managed Care Organizations. The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitiveness of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 299 million people in the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage, and the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage coverage in the U.S. continues to grow in importance. In particular, the influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, consolidation in the MCO industry has resulted in fewer, even larger entities, which enhances MCOs’ ability to negotiate pricing and increases their importance to our business. Since MCOs seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures, their growing influence has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues.

MCOs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to MCO members), clinical protocols (which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier or non-preferred status in their formularies, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost to the patient, resulting in significant patient out-of-pocket expenses. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. The ACA has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs, which creates pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. We are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them.

The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems. MCOs also emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as ways to manage costs. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed, and drugs that can reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy or surgery may become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases.

Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population and beyond. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products, typically on the basis of unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, as well as the overall cost of the therapy. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K.
RAW MATERIALS

We procure raw materials essential to our business from numerous suppliers worldwide. In general, these materials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our demand and in many cases are available from multiple suppliers. We have supplier management activities in place to monitor supply channels and to take action as needed to secure necessary volumes. No significant impact to our operations due to the availability of raw materials is currently anticipated in 2021.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

We are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which we do business. This includes laws and regulations governing pharmaceutical companies, such as the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products, pricing (including discounts and rebates) and health information privacy, among others. These laws and regulations may require administrative guidance for implementation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and administrative actions. Enforcement measures may include substantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-compliant activities, criminal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, exclusion from participation in government programs or contracts as well as limitations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions, and could result in harm to our reputation and business. For additional information, see Note 16A. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be costly, and may require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. While capital expenditures or operating costs for compliance with government regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.

In the United States

Drug and Biologic Regulation. The FDA, pursuant to the FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, extensively regulates pre- and post-marketing activities related to our biopharmaceutical products. The regulations govern areas such as the safety and efficacy of medicines, clinical trials, advertising and promotion, quality control, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-marketing safety surveillance and reporting, and record keeping. Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA, also regulate certain of our products and activities. Many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC.

For a biopharmaceutical company to market a drug or a biologic product in the U.S., the FDA must evaluate whether the product is safe and effective for its intended use. If the FDA determines that the drug or biologic is safe and effective, the FDA will approve the product’s NDA or Biologics License Application (BLA) (or supplemental NDA or supplemental BLA), as appropriate.

A drug or biologic may be subject to postmarketing commitments, which are studies or clinical trials that the product sponsor agrees to conduct, or postmarketing requirements, which are studies or clinical trials that are required as a condition of approval. Once a drug or biologic is approved, the FDA must be notified of any product modifications and may require additional studies or clinical trials. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMPs (the FDA regulations that govern all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals), as well as advertising and promotion regulations. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Development, Regulatory Approval and Marketing of Products and —Post-Approval Data section in this Form 10-K.

In the context of public health emergencies like the COVID-19 pandemic, we may apply for EUA with the FDA, which when granted, allows for the distribution and use of our products during the term declared and extended by the government, in accordance with the conditions set forth in the EUA, unless the EUA is otherwise terminated at the government’s discretion. Although the criteria of an EUA differ from the criteria for approval of an NDA or BLA, EUAs nevertheless require the development and submission of data to satisfy the relevant FDA standards, and a number of ongoing compliance obligations. The FDA expects EUA holders to work toward submission of full applications, such as a BLA, as soon as possible. For BNT162b2, we are working towards submitting a BLA for possible full regulatory approval.

Biosimilar Regulation. The FDA is responsible for approval of biosimilars. Innovator biologics are entitled to 12 years of market exclusivity by statute, and biosimilars applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic.

Sales and Marketing Regulations. Our marketing practices are subject to state laws as well as federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. The Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business. The False Claims Act generally prohibits anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods or services to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. The federal government and states also regulate sales and marketing activities and financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, requiring disclosure to government authorities and the public of such interactions, and the adoption of compliance standards or programs. State attorneys general have also taken action to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws.

Healthcare Reform. Any significant efforts at the federal or state levels to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have a material impact on us. This includes potential replacements for the ACA, if it is ultimately invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court in California v. Texas, as well as efforts at the state level to develop additional public insurance options or implement a single payer healthcare system. We do not expect that invalidation of the ACA itself would have a material impact on our business given the modest revenues the health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion generate for us. However, a future replacement of the ACA or other healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if such replacement or reform reduces incentives for employer-sponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increases industry taxes and fees.

Pricing and Reimbursement. Pricing and reimbursement for our products depend in part on government regulation. In order to have our products covered by Medicaid, we must offer discounts or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state programs. We also must report specific prices to government agencies. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose us to enforcement measures. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues by Geography section within MD&A and Note 1G.

Government and private payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products, and there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. Efforts by states and the federal government to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed actions to facilitate drug importation, limit reimbursement to lower international reference prices, require deep discounts, and require manufacturers to report and make public price increases and sometimes a written justification for the increase, could adversely affect our business if implemented. In the Fall of 2020, the Trump Administration finalized an importation pathway from Canada and a payment model to tie Medicare Part B physician reimbursement to international prices, though ultimate implementation of both is uncertain due to legal challenges. We expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation under the newly elected Congress and the Biden Administration. In addition, U.S. government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Pricing and Reimbursement section in this Form 10-K.

A majority of states use preferred drug lists to manage access to pharmaceutical products under Medicaid, including some of our products. For example, access to our products under the Medicaid and Medicare managed care programs typically is determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies and Medicare contract to provide services to beneficiaries. States seek to control healthcare costs related to Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the Medicaid drug rebate program tied to patient outcomes. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains, wholesalers and PBMs will increase pricing pressures in the industry. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Managed Care Trends section in this Form 10-K.

Anti-Corruption. The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.

Data Privacy. The collection and use of personal data by us as part of our business activities is subject to various federal and state privacy and data security laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Such laws and regulations have the potential to affect our business materially, continue to evolve and are increasingly being enforced vigorously.

Outside the United States

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the U.S.

New Drug Approvals. In the EU, the EMA conducts the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval for the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. From January 1, 2021, as a consequence of the U.K. leaving the EU (Brexit), the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is the sole regulatory authority for the U.K. In China, following significant regulatory reforms in recent years, the NMPA is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines. In Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. Health authorities in many middle- and lower-income require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., the FDA or EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval.

Pharmacovigilance. In the EU/EEA, the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues. Outside developed markets, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.

Pricing and Reimbursement. Certain governments, including in the different EU member states, the U.K., China, Japan, Canada and South Korea, provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global financing pressures. Governments may use a variety of measures including proposing price reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In addition, the international patchwork of price regulation, differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some third-party trade in our products between countries. Several important multilateral organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations. On November 25, 2020, the European Commission published its new Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe which envisions a broad range of new initiatives and legislation including a significant focus on affordability and access to medicines.

In China, pricing pressures have increased in recent years, with government officials emphasizing improved health outcomes, healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards reform. Drug prices have decreased dramatically as a result of adding innovative drugs (including oncology medicines) to the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). In the off-patent space, numerous local generics have been officially deemed bioequivalent under a QCE process that required domestically-manufactured generic drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug (typically the originator drug). A centralized VBP program has also been initiated and expanded nationwide, under which a tender process has been established where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners. The program is intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed QCE, which has resulted in dramatic price cuts for off-patent medicines. Furthermore, the Chinese government has discussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between QCE-approved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines, which the government currently plans to

								
Pfizer Inc.	2020 Form 10-K	
9

implement within the next few years. We and most off-patent originators have mostly not been successful in the VBP bidding process. The government has indicated that additional post-LOE drugs could be subjected to QCE qualification in future rounds, which could also be tied to volume-based procurement. While certain details of future QCE expansion have been made available, we are unable to determine the impact on our business and financial condition until the initiation of these future rounds.

Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. Several countries have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers.

Intellectual Property. Reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factors we consider for continued business and R&D investment. The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) requires participant countries to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by law, with an exemption provided for least-developed countries until 2033. While some countries have made improvements, we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges in many countries.

While the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our growth and ability to bring new product innovation to patients depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In certain developed international markets, governments maintain relatively effective intellectual property policies. However, in the EU, following a review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentives, legislative change may result in the reduction of certain protections. In several emerging market countries, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines, as well as to advance industrial policy and localization goals.

Considerable political and economic pressure has weakened current intellectual property protection in some countries and has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions, revocation of patents, laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection.

Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturers, underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries and helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines.

Data Privacy. Outside of the U.S., many countries have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data, including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulations. The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt privacy and data security laws.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. We incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2020 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows: $42 million in environment-related capital expenditures and $120 million in other environment-related expenses.

While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position. See also Note 16A3.

Climate change presents risks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities or supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future. We periodically review our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and other natural disasters and update our assessments accordingly. Based on our reviews, we do not believe these potential risks are material to our operations at this time.
HUMAN CAPITAL

Our purpose is clear: Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. These breakthroughs are delivered through the relentless collaboration of our talented workforce. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 78,500 people worldwide, with approximately 29,400 based in the U.S. Women compose approximately 48% of our workforce, and approximately 32% of our U.S.-based employees are individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds.
Our continued success links directly to the commitment, engagement and performance of our employees. It is important that we not only attract and retain the best and brightest diverse talent but also ensure they remain engaged and can thrive in an environment that is committed to helping them grow, succeed and contribute directly to achieving our purpose. As part of these efforts, we strive for an inclusive and empowering work environment, adopting practices to simplify processes and remove needless complexity, rewarding both performance and leadership skills, and offering competitive compensation and benefits programs that encourage healthy work-life balance, so that all colleagues feel ready, equipped and energized to deliver innovative breakthroughs that extend and significantly improve patients’ lives.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. At Pfizer, every person deserves to be seen, heard and cared for, and we work to further this goal by bringing together people with different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences. Our new and expanded commitments to equity include specific actions to help foster a more inclusive environment within Pfizer, including, among others: (i) increasing the representation of both women and underrepresented ethnic groups; (ii) providing resources to support managers in having courageous conversations about equity, race and the avoidance of bias within their teams; (iii) revising our Political Action Committee (PAC) bylaws to help ensure that PAC recipients consistently demonstrate conduct that align with our core values; and (iv) working to help ensure recruitment demographics of all clinical trials correlate to those of the countries where trials are taking place.

Colleague Engagement. We understand the importance of continuously listening and responding to colleague feedback. Our annual engagement survey, Pfizer Pulse, provides a forum for our colleagues to give structured feedback about their Pfizer experience and equips leaders with

								
Pfizer Inc.	2020 Form 10-K	
10

actionable insights for discussion and follow up. Regular topics in the survey include (i) employee engagement, such as colleagues’ commitment to and advocacy for Pfizer, and (ii) purpose, including how colleagues’ work connects with our purpose. Through these surveys, we can measure and track the degree to which colleagues are proud to work at Pfizer, would recommend Pfizer as a great place to work to others and intend to stay with Pfizer.

Performance, Leadership and Growth. We are committed to helping our colleagues reach their full potential by rewarding both their performance and leadership skills and by providing opportunities for growth and development. Our performance management approach—called Performance and Leadership Insights—is based on six-month semesters during which our colleagues and their managers set goals, receive feedback and meet to discuss performance. These conversations are meant to help colleagues grow and develop by evaluating performance (what the colleague achieved, measured by outcomes), leadership (how they achieved it, taking into account Pfizer’s values of courage, excellence, equity and joy), and identifying areas of growth that help move colleagues towards fulfilling their career goals and their potential. We strive to ensure that all colleagues have an equal opportunity to grow and offer a variety of programs including mentoring, job rotations, experiential project roles, skill based volunteering and learning programs focused on many topics, including leadership and management skills and industry- and job-specific learning, as well as general business, manufacturing, finance and technology skills.

Health, Safety and Well-Being. We are committed to the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues and continue to advance a comprehensive occupational injury and illness prevention program.

During 2020, our COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and response was a primary focus. Our comprehensive pandemic response plan incorporates guidance issued by external health authorities and is designed to keep onsite workers at our manufacturing and research sites safe and healthy. A global employee assistance program provides stress management, mental health, emotional, resiliency and pandemic guidance and support to our colleagues.

Pay Equity. We are committed to pay equity, based on gender or race/ethnicity, and we conduct and report publicly on pay equity on an annual basis.

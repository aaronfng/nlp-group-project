General Electric Company (General Electric, GE or the Company) is a high-tech industrial company that operates worldwide through its four industrial segments, Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation and Healthcare, and its financial services segment, Capital. See the Segment Operations section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition (MD&A) for segment business descriptions and product and service offerings. See the Consolidated Results section within MD&A and Results of Operations and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding our recent business portfolio actions. Results of segments reclassified to discontinued operations have been recast for all periods presented.

We serve customers in over 170 countries. Manufacturing and service operations are carried out at 82 manufacturing plants located in 28 states in the United States and Puerto Rico and at 149 manufacturing plants located in 34 other countries.

In all of our global business activities, we encounter aggressive and able competition. In many instances, the competitive climate is characterized by changing technology that requires continuing research and development. With respect to manufacturing operations, we believe that, in general, we are one of the leading firms in most of the major industries in which we participate. The businesses in which GE Capital engages are subject to competition from various types of financial institutions.

As a diverse global company, we are affected by world economies, instability in certain regions, commodity prices, foreign currency volatility and policies regarding trade and imports. See the Segment Operations section within MD&A for further information. Other factors impacting our business include:
•product development cycles for many of our products are long and product quality and efficiency are critical to success,
•research and development expenditures are important to our business,
•many of our products are subject to a number of regulatory standards and
•changing end markets, including shifts in energy sources and demand and the impact of technology changes.

We own, or hold licenses to use, numerous patents. New patents are continuously being obtained through our research and development activities as existing patents expire. Patented inventions are used both within the Company and are licensed to others. GE is a trademark and service mark of General Electric Company.

Because of the diversity of our products and services, as well as the wide geographic dispersion of our production facilities, we use numerous sources for the wide variety of raw materials needed for our operations. We have not been adversely affected by our inability to obtain raw materials.

The strength and talent of our workforce are critical to the success of our businesses, and we continually strive to attract, develop and retain personnel commensurate with the needs of our businesses in their operating environments. The Company’s human capital management priorities are designed to support the execution of our business strategy and improve organizational effectiveness. We monitor various factors across our priorities, including as a part of our business operating reviews during the year. The priorities focus on:
•Protecting the health and safety of our workforce: GE is committed to establishing and maintaining effective health and safety standards and protocols across our businesses, ensuring continuous process improvement and providing ongoing education.
•Sustaining a Company culture based in leadership behaviors of humility, transparency and focus with a commitment to unyielding integrity: GE’s organizational culture supports talent attraction, engagement and retention and ensures our ways of working are strongly connected to our goals.
•Developing and managing our talent to best support our organizational goals: GE’s approach to talent management aims to ensure strong individual and company performance; our development offerings are designed to support these goals.
•Promoting inclusion and diversity across the enterprise: GE is committed to fostering an inclusive culture, where everyone feels empowered to do their best work.

At year-end 2020, General Electric Company and consolidated affiliates employed approximately 174,000 people, of whom approximately 56,000 were employed in the United States. Our Power, Renewable Energy, Aviation, Healthcare, and Capital segments employed approximately 34,000, 40,000, 40,000, 47,000 and 2,000 people, respectively. In addition, Corporate employed approximately 10,000 employees. Compared to the year-end 2019 figure of 205,000, the number of those employed at year-end 2020 decreased primarily as a result of restructuring, including actions at GE businesses to manage risk and proactively mitigate the financial impact from COVID-19 and efforts to reduce Corporate costs, and business exits.

In the United States, GE has approximately 5,990 union-represented manufacturing and service employees, the majority of whom are covered by four-year collective bargaining agreements ratified in August 2019. GE’s relationship with employee-representative organizations outside the U.S. takes many forms, including in Europe where GE engages employees’ representatives’ bodies such as works councils and trade unions in accordance with local law.

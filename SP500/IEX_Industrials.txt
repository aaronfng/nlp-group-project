Human Capital Management

We recognize that our success would not be possible without the valuable contributions of our workforce. Investment in our people enables us to accomplish our goals and deliver innovative customer solutions. Our corporate Human Capital strategy is overseen by our Chief Human Resource Officer (“CHRO”). Annually, the CHRO presents a talent review to the Company’s Board of Directors. As part of the review, the team details each enterprise-level senior leadership position and outlines succession plans to ensure the Board is informed of the Company’s plans for business continuity and success.

Our workforce advancement strategy succeeds through investment in three pillars: skill-building for the entire workforce, leadership development aligned with the Company’s methodology and fostering a great culture. Our approach to training and education helps drive long-term value by providing our employees with opportunities to develop skills both individually and as teams:
•Employees have access to learning through a variety of sources, including the IDEX Academy, which is our primary platform for global leadership development programs, local development programs and specific individual development plans. These trainings also help to develop future and potential leaders in the IDEX leadership methodology.
•We also enable employee development and growth by offering our full-time U.S. employees who have at least six months of service the ability to participate in our Tuition Reimbursement program. Through the program, employees can have certain expenses from secondary educational institutions reimbursed up to $5,250 per year.
•The Company also built the IDEX Accelerating Management Potential (“I-AMP”) Collegiate Talent Program in 2018 to give early career professionals the opportunity to learn the Company’s values and business, and to grow within our Company in both full-time and internship roles. Since the program began, over 75 percent of participants have represented either gender or ethnic minority groups, and we will continue our focus on providing opportunities for diverse early career professionals through I-AMP.
•We prioritize hiring team members who will embrace our team-driven culture and also place considerable emphasis on leveraging the talented employees within our internal pipeline, filling many leadership positions with Company employees.
•Across the enterprise, our goal is to achieve manufacturing company top quartile employee engagement as measured by our engagement survey. Given the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to the work environment, we are thrilled that our employees are staying engaged as we remain in the 85th percentile among manufacturing companies with employee engagement at 78%.

Employee Pay and Benefits

Attracting and retaining top talent is critical to the success of the Company’s business. We offer a highly competitive pay and benefits package for our employees in all the markets where we operate. The performance-based pay packages provide many employees with short-term performance incentives. We also provide equity-based, long-term incentives to the Company’s senior leaders.

The Company’s U.S. employees can participate in two 401(k) retirement plans and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows an employee to purchase IDEX stock through payroll deductions.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

The Company has always recognized diversity as foundational to creativity and resilience; the three pillars of Innovation, Diversity and Excellence form the acronym that is our name, IDEX. Gender, ethnic, cultural and other human diversity is critical to our success.

In 2020, the Company engaged a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”) coach to work with the CEO and entire Executive Leadership Team to further the DE&I strategic framework. In 2021, the Company intends to fill the currently vacant executive role for DE&I, which will report directly to the CEO.

At least once per year, the Board of Directors reviews employee diversity performance through its CHRO-led senior talent review. Additionally, the Company tracks diversity performance of the top 400 leaders and provides regular updates to the Board on how leadership demographics are changing over time. The Board has also recently pledged to include a DE&I topic on the agenda of every regularly scheduled Board meeting moving forward. In 2020, we increased representation for both women and people of color in our leadership ranks. Since 2018, we have increased the number of senior leaders globally who are women by more than 27% and leaders in the U.S. who are racially or ethnically diverse of color by 23%.

Further, the Company has been conducting pay equity analysis for U.S. employees since 2018 to ensure that employees’ actual pay was substantially similar to their predicted pay. Where appropriate, we provided base pay adjustments for employees that were outliers from their predicted pay, further reinforcing the Company’s commitment to diversity and a culture of inclusion, equality and respect.

Workplace Health & Safety

We are proud to manufacture product components that save lives; this would not be possible without the health and safety of our employees and contractors. The Company’s Employee Health & Safety (“EH&S”) Vision Policy outlines our approach for health and safety governance and applies to all of the Company’s business units and provides for both monthly and annual

Table of Contents
risk assessments which are reviewed by the Company’s senior leaders. We also require safety trainings on topics such as CPR, electrical safety, ergonomics, first aid and machine guarding that all business unit employees must complete every year.

We also encourage all our full-time employees enrolled in our U.S. Healthcare Benefit Plan to participate in our third-party operated Wellness Program which provides access to annual biometric screenings, health evaluations and wellness credits that can be earned for meeting individual wellness goals each year. A number of our business units organize complementary wellness programs, including walking clubs, health fairs and lunch and learns with nutritionists for their employees.

At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we acted quickly, forming the IDEX COVID-19 Task Force to protect our employees from the virus, focusing on our safety-first approach. Among other safety measures, we also implemented COVID-19 Temporary Pay and Benefits Policy for employees who regularly work 20 or more hours per week, which provided four weeks of leave with 100% pay and benefits, in order to assist employees impacted by COVID-19 circumstances with additional flexibility.

Suppliers

The Company manufactures many of the parts and components used in its products. Substantially all materials, parts and components purchased by the Company are available from multiple sources.

Inventory and Backlog

The Company regularly and systematically adjusts production schedules and quantities based on the flow of incoming orders. Backlogs typically are limited to two months of production. While total inventory levels also may be affected by changes in orders, the Company generally tries to maintain relatively stable inventory levels based on its assessment of the requirements of the various industries served.

Raw Materials

The Company uses a wide variety of raw materials which are generally available from a number of sources. As a result, shortages from any single supplier have not had, and are not likely to have a material impact on operations.

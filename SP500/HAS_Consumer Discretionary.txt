Fiscal 2020 Developments
•Acquisition of Entertainment One. Fiscal 2020 began with the completion of our acquisition of eOne, a global entertainment company. eOne adds global children’s brands, such as PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS to our portfolio, and brings experienced talent, expertise and capabilities across television, film and other

forms of entertainment. Throughout 2020 we successfully integrated many parts of our business and have started to achieve synergies as a combined company.
•Coronavirus Pandemic. During fiscal 2020 and continuing into fiscal 2021, the world has been significantly impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Overall we experienced accelerated growth in our ecommerce, and in particular, sales of games, as consumers did more shopping on-line and families were playing more games while at home. We also experienced increased interest in our Wizards of the Coast table-top gaming and entertainment content, as consumers were searching for entertainment options during the pandemic. The pandemic did, however, have a substantial adverse impact on our business, as well as our employees, consumers, customers, partners, licensees, suppliers and manufacturers, due in part to the preventative measures taken to reduce the spread of the virus. These preventative measures included restrictions on business operations, temporary closures or limited reopening of many retail, manufacturing and entertainment production businesses, shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, and other voluntary and government imposed restrictions.
We experienced:
◦Strong consumer and audience demand for games and content;
◦disruptions in supply of products due to closures or reductions in operations at third-party manufacturing facilities across several geographies including, but not limited to, China, India, the United States and Ireland, as well as increased costs and difficulties in shipping and distributing products;
◦adverse sales impact due to changes in consumer purchasing behavior and availability of products to consumers, resulting from retail store closures, limited reopening of retail stores and limitations on the capacity of ecommerce channels to supply additional products;
◦fluctuations in our performance based on the progress of different countries in controlling the coronavirus and the maturity of e-commerce platforms in those markets.
◦limited production of live-action scripted and unscripted live-action entertainment content due to the shutdown and gradual reopening of production studios;
◦delays or postponements of entertainment productions and releases of entertainment content both internally and by our partners; and
◦challenges of working remotely.
In response to these challenges, we developed and continue to develop and execute plans to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to the business. Our responses included:
◦utilizing our global supply chain and existing inventory to work to meet demand, as our manufacturing facilities returned to varying levels of operation;
◦creatively finding ways to accelerate our business online and expand omni-channel to get products to customers;
◦developing innovative ways to enable players to continue to play MAGIC: THE GATHERING games remotely; and
◦continuing to develop new entertainment, including working on animation productions and post-production work, which were able to be worked on remotely.
We have maintained sufficient liquidity and access to capital resources. We also continue to closely manage expenses to further preserve liquidity and we continually monitor customer health and collectability of receivables. The COVID-19 outbreak continues to be fluid and it is difficult to forecast the impact it could have on our future operations. Please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K for further information.

Brand Blueprint Strategy
Our strategic plan is centered around Hasbro’s Brand Blueprint, a framework for bringing compelling and expansive brand experiences to consumers and audiences around the world. Our brands are story-led consumer franchises brought to life through a wide array of consumer products, compelling content offered across a multitude of platforms and media, including a variety of digital experiences, as well as music, publishing and live entertainment.
has-20201227_g2.jpg
Hasbro's purpose of making the world a better place for all children, fans and families sits at the center of the Hasbro Brand Blueprint and a key driver of Hasbro brands and content. The development and execution of our brands and content are informed by our proprietary consumer insights, which help us understand the behavior of our consumers, from a consumption of content and play standpoint. We have learned that consumers will travel with a brand that they love across multiple forms and formats, including our core historical strength of toys and games and licensed consumer products, as well as digital gaming and story-led entertainment, including short-form content online and long-form content in television and film.
Our acquisition of eOne expands our brands and the capabilities around the Hasbro Brand Blueprint.
•New Family Brands. eOne adds established preschool brands as well as the capability to build new brands. These highly merchandisable properties include PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS, as well as emerging properties and other brands that are in development.
•Proven TV and Film Experience. eOne’s proven television and film expertise and leadership enhances our storytelling capabilities in television, film and other mediums. eOne’s independent studios enable us to develop, own and distribute robust and entertaining stories around our brands and other intellectual property, through animation, unscripted and scripted live action television and entertainment as well as in feature films. By developing, owning and strategically distributing content, the acquisition positions us to capture more franchise economics created and perpetuated by differentiated platforms.
As the global consumer landscape, shopping behaviors and the retail and entertainment environments continue to evolve, we continue to adapt and refine our business strategy. This process includes reexamining the ways we organize across the Hasbro Brand Blueprint, re-shaping our business into a more adaptive and digitally-driven organization, expanding our ecommerce capabilities and attracting and developing a high-performing and diverse workforce through human capital investments.
Below is summary of the key areas of focus for activating our brands across the Hasbro Brand Blueprint.
•Toys and Games. We market and sell toys and games based on our owned and controlled brands globally at retail stores, through ecommerce platforms and through our fan-based direct-to-consumer platform, Hasbro PULSE. Additionally, through license agreements with third parties, we develop and sell products

based on popular third party partner brands through these channels. Our toys and games include action figures, arts and crafts and creative play products, fashion and other dolls, play sets, preschool toys, plush products, sports action blasters and accessories, vehicles and toy-related specialty products, traditional games and many other consumer products which represent an array of internationally recognizable brands that capture the imagination of our consumers worldwide.
Within toys and games, as a leading producer of new and innovative gaming brands and play experiences our gaming business continues to transform game play. To successfully execute our gaming strategy, we consider brands which capitalize on existing trends while evolving our approach to gaming using consumer insights and offering gaming experiences relevant to consumer demand for face-to-face, trading card and digital game experiences played as board, off-the-board, digital, card, electronic, trading card and role-playing games.
Our subsidiary, Wizards of the Coast (“Wizards”), is a critical part of our gaming business, driving innovation and growth through its popular role-playing and fantasy card-collecting games such as MAGIC: THE GATHERING and DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. Our traditional game brands include long-time favorites such as MONOPOLY, JENGA, CONNECT 4, THE GAME OF LIFE, SCRABBLE, CLUE and TRIVIAL PURSUIT. Our gaming business also includes new social games brands as well as many other well-known game brands.
•Licensed Consumer Products. We promote our brands through the out-licensing of our intellectual properties to third parties for promotional and merchandising uses in a wide range of consumer products. These include apparel, publishing, home goods and electronics, or in certain situations, toy products where we consider the out-licensing of brands to be more effective and profitable than developing and marketing the products ourselves. We also out-license our brands for uses in theme park attractions, other forms of location-based entertainment and within formats such as film and TV programming. In cases where we license our intellectual property to a third party, we enter into contracts with licensees that pay us either a sales-based or usage-based royalty, or a combination of both, for use of the brands, and, in some cases, the license arrangements are subject to minimum guaranteed amounts or fixed fees, over the term of the license.
•Digital Gaming. We are investing to grow our digital gaming business to further unlock the value of our brands through play and storytelling. This includes development of digital games internally and through third parties. For example, we have developed and launched digital versions of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game, MAGIC: THE GATHERING ARENA, and expect to launch this game in mobile applications in 2021. Through Wizards we are working on the development of Dark Alliance, a team-based game and adventure set in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS world. Additionally, we out-license certain of our brands to other third-party digital game developers who transform Hasbro brand-based characters and other intellectual properties, into digital gaming experiences. This includes Baldur's Gate 3 DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, that we are developing with our partner, Larian Studios.
•Entertainment. A key driver of the Hasbro Brand Blueprint is to reinforce storylines associated with our brands through several entertainment mediums, including television, film, digital content and other programming.
•Throughout 2020, as we integrated eOne's creative talent and network of studios, eOne has assumed the leadership of our entertainment-driven brand storytelling. Our entertainment business is now a fully operational, global studio, that specializes in the development, acquisition, production, financing, distribution and sales of entertainment content. With our cross-platform capabilities, we believe our entertainment business is positioned to leverage film, television and music production and sales, digital content and family programming to create compelling entertainment and drive creativity across brands with merchandising and licensing tie-ins.
◦Family Brands Animation. eOne’s family brands team develops, produces and distributes animation content for children’s properties on a worldwide basis. The principal brand is PEPPA PIG, which was launched in the United Kingdom in May 2004. This brand entertains preschool children worldwide with much of its historical revenue generated through licensing and merchandising programs across multiple retail categories. eOne’s portfolio of preschool brands also includes PJ MASKS, CUPCAKE & DINO: GENERAL SERVICES, and RICKY ZOOM. Given eOne’s expertise in this area, the eOne Family Brands team will continue the development of animation for our brands, including MY LITTLE PONY. This work continued during 2020 despite the pandemic.

◦Television. Television programming based on our brands currently airs in markets throughout the world. Domestically, we distribute programming to Discovery Family Channel (the “Network”), a joint venture between Discovery Communications, Inc. (“Discovery”) and Hasbro which operates a cable television network in the United States dedicated to high-quality children’s and family entertainment and educational programming. Additionally, we distribute certain programming domestically to other outlets. Internationally, we distribute to various broadcasters and cable networks. We also distribute programming globally on various digital platforms, including Netflix. In 2016, Hasbro acquired Boulder Media, an animation studio based in Dublin, Ireland that produces a variety of animation projects, including those for third parties.
With the acquisition of eOne, we have significantly expanded our television production and distribution capabilities. eOne is a major independent producer of television content primarily in North America. eOne focuses on the development, production and acquisition of high-quality television programming for sale to broadcasters and digital platforms globally. eOne develops and produces original television programming for broadcast in its core television production territories of Canada and the U.S., which is then distributed into global markets by eOne’s own international sales network. eOne typically finances its television programming on a production‑by‑production basis by way of production financing facilities. eOne’s original television programming is sold to broadcasters on a series‑by‑series or individual show basis for broadcast on free television, pay television, Subscription Video‑On‑Demand and other digital platforms. Its programming spans a variety of genres, including scripted drama, non‑scripted reality and documentaries, and in multiple formats, including series, television films, mini‑series and specials.
◦Film.
With the addition of eOne’s global independent film business, we have expanded our capabilities in this area. eOne focuses on the production and co-production of a growing number of films, some of which are based on Hasbro brands, as well as the acquisition and development of film production rights and the exploitation of these rights on a multi‑territory basis across all media channels, including cinema, physical home entertainment and broadcast and digital.
In 2020, due to the pandemic, the industry saw delays or postponements in releases of films, or in some cases films were released direct to streaming or to streaming after a limited theater release. We expect these trends could continue in the near future.
In October 2017, we entered into an agreement with Paramount Pictures (“Paramount”) to produce and distribute live action and animated films, as well as television programming based on Hasbro brands over a five-year period. Hasbro’s Allspark Pictures, Allspark Animation and now eOne play an active role alongside Paramount in content development and production under this relationship and Hasbro plays a more significant role in financing the films.
Jointly, with Paramount Pictures, we have several upcoming feature length films with planned release dates in 2021 and 2022, including SNAKE EYES: G.I. JOE ORIGINS, expected to be released in the fall of 2021, a TRANSFORMERS feature length film expected in 2022 as well as a planned DUNGEONS & DRAGONS feature length film.
•Other Brand Blueprint Areas. Other aspects of the Hasbro Brand Blueprint that help drive our storytelling experiences include music, digital content, e-sports, location-based entertainment, and publishing.
◦Music. Through our acquisition of eOne, we operate a music label, which produces and releases music tracks and albums from artists across a wide variety of genres, and we own rights to a sizable catalog of music. Our music business provides a source of music content for film and television productions and allows us to monetize some of the music produced from our films and television programs. We also have a global music business specializing in management, publishing and live events across a wide variety of genres. The music business also includes UK-based Audio Network, an independent creator and publisher of original high quality music for use in film, television, advertising and digital media.
◦Digital Content. We understand the importance of digital content to drive fan engagement, including in gaming and across other media, and of integrating such content with our products. Digital media encompasses digital gaming applications and the creation of digital environments for analog products through the use of complementary digital applications, social media and websites which extend storylines and enhance play.

◦E-sports. We continue to seek innovative ways to bring our traditional games to the digital world, where consumers can experience our brands and compete with each other in a multiplayer online adventure experience. A prime example of this is MAGIC: THE GATHERING ARENA, our digital gaming version of the MAGIC:THE GATHERING trading card game. ARENA, initially launched in 2019, has become a leading e-sports game.
◦Location-Based Entertainment. Location-based entertainment (“LBE”) allows consumers to experience and share our brands. LBE includes licensing our brands to theme parks, water parks, hotels and resorts, family entertainment centers, retail, dining and entertainment, shows, exhibits and exhibitions. These experiences bring our brands to life and further immerse our consumers in our storytelling.
◦Publishing. Licensing our brands to global publishers is another way to bring our brands to consumers in a meaningful way through various publishing formats, from puzzle and trivia books to novels and comics.

Over time we have increased the amount of product we source outside China, including in India and Vietnam. As of December 27, 2020, 45% of third-party product manufacturing was sourced outside of China.
 
•Additional Segment Information.
◦To further extend our range of products in the various segments of our business, we sell a portion of our toy and game products to retailers on a direct import basis from the Far East. These sales are reflected in the revenue of the related segment where the customer is geographically located.
◦Certain of our products are licensed to other companies for sale in selected countries where we do not otherwise have a direct business presence.
◦For more financial information regarding our segments, please see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements, of this Form 10-K.
•Fiscal 2021 Reportable Segments. Given the evolution and reorganization of our company in recent years, including as a result of our acquisition of eOne, we plan to realign our reporting segment structure in 2021 to reflect how future operating results will be organized for decision-making purposes and for assessing the Company’s performance. This realignment is expected to integrate the eOne segment and certain legacy Hasbro segments into a new reporting segment structure. However, in 2020, management views eOne’s operations separately from the Hasbro’s legacy business.
Working Capital Requirements; Seasonality
Our working capital needs are financed through cash generated from operations, primarily through the sale of toys and games and secondarily through our consumer products licensing and entertainment operations, and, when necessary, proceeds from short-term borrowings.
Our customer order patterns may vary from year to year largely due to fluctuations in the degree of consumer acceptance of product lines, product availability, marketing strategies and inventory policies of retailers, the dates of theatrical releases of major motion pictures for which we offer products, and changes in overall economic conditions. A disproportionate volume of our net revenues has historically been earned during the third and fourth quarters leading up to the retail industry’s holiday selling season, including Christmas. As a result, comparisons of unshipped orders on any date with those at the same date in the prior year are not necessarily indicative of our sales for that year. Moreover, quick response, or just-in-time, inventory management practices result in a significant proportion of orders being placed for immediate delivery. Although the Company may receive orders from customers in advance, it is general industry practice that these orders are subject to amendment or cancellation by customers prior to shipment and, as such, the Company does not believe that these unshipped orders, at any given date, are necessarily indicative of future sales. We expect retailers will continue to follow this strategy. In 2020 and 2019, the second half of the year accounted for approximately 64% of full year revenues with the third and fourth quarters accounting for approximately 33% and 31%, respectively, of full year net revenues in both years.
Historically, we commit to the majority of our inventory production and advertising and marketing expenditures for a given year, prior to the peak fourth quarter retail selling season. Our accounts receivable balances increase during the third and fourth quarters as customers increase their purchases to meet expected consumer demand in the holiday season. Due to the concentrated timeframe of this selling period, payments for these accounts receivable are generally not due until later in the fourth quarter or early in the first quarter of the subsequent year. The timing difference between expenses paid and revenues collected sometimes makes it necessary for us to borrow varying amounts during the year, however, we have had sufficient liquidity and capital resources throughout 2020 and 2019 and have not had to borrow under our revolving credit facility.

Table of Contents
Our entertainment business is also subject to seasonal variations based on the timing of film, television, streaming and digital content releases, which are often determined based on the timing of prime television seasons, certain geographic release dates and competition in the market.
Product Development and Royalties
Development
Our success is dependent on continuous innovation in our play and entertainment offerings and requires ongoing development of new brands and products alongside the redesign of existing products to drive consumer interest and market acceptance. Our toy and game products are developed by a global development function, the costs of which are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments. These costs include activities related to the development, design and engineering of new products and their packaging and on the improvement or modification of ongoing products. Much of this work is performed by our internal staff of designers, artists, model makers and engineers.
Development and related costs associated with Wizards of the Coast products are specifically allocated to that line of business, including significant investments in digital gaming, most notably, for the development of MAGIC: THE GATHERING ARENA, the free-to-play online adaptation of the MAGIC: THE GATHERING card game, launched in 2019 and additional games to be released in the coming years.
In addition to the design and development work performed by our own staff, we work with a number of independent toy and game designers, for whose designs and ideas we compete with other toy and game manufacturers. Rights to such designs and ideas, when acquired or licensed by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the designer a royalty on our net sales of the item. These designer royalty agreements may also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees.
Royalties and Participations
We also produce an array of products under licenses based on our partners’ trademarks and copyrights for the names or likenesses of characters from movies, television shows and other entertainment media, or whose rights we compete with other toy and game manufacturers. We refer to these products as Partner Brands. Licensing fees for these rights are generally paid as a royalty on our net sales of the item. Licenses for the use of characters may be exclusive for specific products or product lines in specified territories, or may be non-exclusive, in which case our product offerings may be competing with the product offerings of other licensees. In many instances, advance royalties and minimum guarantees are required by these license agreements. Our royalty expense in any given year may also vary depending upon the timing of movie releases and other entertainment media.
Our entertainment offerings also require us to pay royalties and participations to those involved in the creation of the content, such as producers, writers, directors and actors. With the acquisition of eOne, those royalties and participations have become more significant.
Marketing and Sales, Customer Concentration and Advertising
Marketing and Sales
While our global development function focuses on brand and product innovation and re-invention, our global marketing function establishes brand direction and messaging and assists the selling entities in establishing local marketing programs. The global marketing group works cross-functionally with the global development function to deliver unified, brand-specific consumer experiences. The costs of this group are allocated to the selling entities which comprise our principal operating segments. In addition to the global marketing function, our local selling entities employ sales and marketing functions responsible for local market activities and execution.
Our products are sold globally to a broad spectrum of customers, including chain stores, distributors, wholesalers, discount stores, drug stores, mail order houses, catalog stores, department stores and other traditional retailers, large and small, as well as ecommerce retailers and direct-to-customer through Hasbro PULSE, our fan-based ecommerce website. Our own sales forces account for the majority of sales of our products with remaining sales generated by independent distributors who, for the most part, sell our products in areas of the world where we do not otherwise maintain a direct presence. The majority of our sales are to large chain stores, distributors, e-retailers and wholesalers.
Customer Concentration
During 2020, net revenues from our top five retail customers accounted for approximately 35% of our consolidated global net revenues, including our largest customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Amazon.com and Target Corporation, who represented 15%, 10% and 8%, respectively, of consolidated global net revenues. In 2020, ecommerce sales
17
Table of Contents
represented a significant portion of overall sales to these customers as consumers increasingly purchased our products online as compared to in-store shopping due to the shutdown and limited access to retail stores during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to our supply chain and logistics investments in recent years, we were better positioned to handle the increasing amount of ecommerce sales resulting from customers’ changing shopping patterns due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the U.S. and Canada segment, approximately 59% of our net revenues were derived from our top three customers. Please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of risks relating to customer concentration.
Advertising
We advertise many of our products extensively and brands through digital marketing and on television. Products are strategically cross-promoted by spotlighting specific products alongside related offerings in a manner that promotes the sale of not only the selected item, but also those complementary products.
As described earlier, the Hasbro Brand Blueprint strategy includes focusing on reinforcing storylines associated with our brands through several mediums, including television, film, digital gaming and live action experiences. Our brands obtain marketing and advertising support through entertainment appearing on major networks globally as well as on various other digital platforms, such as Netflix. In addition, through the leadership of eOne, our brands are supported through animated and live action theatrical releases. The creative talent at eOne will help activate and re-ignite our brands, including brands from our vault, by leading the creation of branded-content. The most current example of this is the MY LITTLE PONY animated film produced by the eOne Family Brands team, which is expected to be released in late 2021.
Many of our new toy and game products are introduced to major customers within one to two years leading up to their year of retail introduction. We have historically showcased certain new products through international toy shows, including New York City, Hong Kong and Nuremburg, Germany. The toy fairs we have attended in the past were either canceled or postponed for 2021 due to the pandemic. Our advertising expenditures are impacted by our product mix in any given year. For example, brands based on major motion picture releases generally require less advertising as a result of the promotional activities around the motion picture release, whereas leading into a major digital gaming launch, our Wizards of the Coast business will have substantial increases to advertising, marketing and promotional expenses to acquire players and promote gaming releases.
Producing, marketing and distributing films and television programming can involve significant costs and the timing of a film’s release can cause our financial results to vary. For instance, marketing costs are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film and, to a lesser extent, other distribution windows, and are expensed as incurred. Therefore, we typically incur losses with respect to a particular film prior to and during the film’s theatrical release and profitability for the film may not be realized until after its theatrical release window.
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
During 2020, the majority of our products were manufactured in third party facilities in the Far East, primarily China, India and Vietnam, as well as in two of our previously owned facilities now operated by Cartamundi, which are located in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts and Waterford, Ireland. Cartamundi continues to manufacture significant quantities of game products for us under a multi-year manufacturing agreement. We are continuing our efforts to diversify our global sourcing mix and decrease our dependence on Chinese manufacturing by increasing production of our products in other countries, including India and Vietnam. As of December 27, 2020, 45% of third-party product manufacturing was sourced outside of China.
Certain eOne products, such as products relating to PEPPA PIG and PJ MASKS, are currently managed and distributed through third-party licensing agents. Beginning in second half 2021, we plan to in-source production, distribution and licensing of certain toy and game products associated with these acquired brands.
During the first part of 2020, we faced manufacturing challenges where operations were either shut down for a period of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic or were operating at limited capacity. Fortunately, during that period, our supply needs were at a lower point of the seasonality of our sales, which are more heavily weighted to the third and fourth quarter of the year. At this time, we believe the manufacturing capacity of our third-party manufacturers, as well as the supply of components, accessories and completed products which we purchase from unaffiliated manufacturers, are adequate to meet the anticipated demand in 2021 for our products. However, if we or our suppliers suffer prolonged manufacturing disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the coronavirus, manufacturing capacity of our third-party manufacturers as well as supply of components, accessories and our products may be adversely impacted. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K for further information.

Most of our toys and games are manufactured from basic raw materials such as plastic, paper and cardboard, although certain products also use electronic components. All of these materials are readily available but may be subject to significant fluctuations in price. There are certain chemicals (including phthalates and BPA) that national, state and local governments have restricted or are seeking to restrict or limit the use of; however, we do not believe these restrictions have or will materially impact our business. We generally enter into agreements with suppliers at the beginning of a fiscal year that establish prices for that year. However, significant volatility in the prices of any of these materials may require renegotiation with our suppliers during the year.
Competition
We are a worldwide leader in the development, design, sale and marketing of toys and games and entertainment offerings, operating in a highly competitive business environment. We compete with several large toy and game companies in our product categories, as well as with many smaller United States and international toy and game designers, manufacturers and marketers. We also compete with other companies that offer TV and film content and branded entertainment specific to children and their families. Given the ease of entry into our business we view our primary competition as coming from content providers and toy and game companies who are creating entertainment experiences that compete with our brand-driven storytelling and product experiences for consumer attention and spending. Businesses that create compelling content can readily translate that content into a full range of product offerings. Competition is based primarily on meeting consumer entertainment preferences and on the quality and play value of our products and experiences. To a lesser extent, competition is also based on product pricing.
Our entertainment business competes with other companies that produce and distribute films, television programs and other entertainment content. For example, eOne, as an independent distributor and producer, competes with other major U.S. and international studios that typically release a large number of films annually and command a significant share of box office and streaming revenues and television airtime, as well as other independent film and television production or distribution companies. Many of the major U.S. studios are part of large, diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations, including television networks and cable channels that can provide both in-house distribution capability and varied sources of earnings that may allow them to better offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and television operations. Some of these competitors have substantially greater marketing and financial resources than we do and may be able to compete aggressively on pricing in order to increase box office revenues and television airtime or streaming placement. In addition, the resources of the major studios may give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets, including content libraries, that we might also be interested in acquiring. The competition we face may cause us to lose market share, achieve lower prices for our productions or pay more for third party content, any of which could harm our business. Additionally, the Discovery Family Channel, our cable television joint venture with Discovery Communications, Inc. in the U.S., competes with a number of other children’s television networks for viewers, advertising revenue and distribution fees.
In addition to contending with competition from other toy and game and entertainment and storytelling companies, we contend with the phenomenon that children are increasingly sophisticated and have been moving away from traditional toys and games. The variety of digital gaming and digital entertainment offerings available for children has expanded and product life cycles of traditional toys and games have shortened as children move on to more sophisticated offerings at earlier ages. As a result, our products not only compete with those offerings produced by other toy and game manufacturers and companies offering branded family play and entertainment, we also compete, particularly in meeting the demands of older children, with entertainment offerings of many technology companies, such as makers of tablets, mobile devices, video games and other digital gaming products and screens, and social media companies.
The changing trends in consumer preferences with respect to entertainment and low barriers to entry as well as the emergence of new technologies and different mediums for viewing content, such as streaming, continually creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups to develop products and offerings that compete with our entertainment and toy and game offerings.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
Overview
At Hasbro, we understand that doing well includes doing good in the world and for all our constituents. Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) has gone from being an important consideration in our business strategy to being a central focus, integral to our success. The priority ESG areas where we are deeply invested in tackling are ethical sourcing, environmental sustainability, product safety and culture & human capital. Each of these areas has a wider aperture in today’s world and within our current business.

At the same time, we continued to make meaningful progress across all of our CSR priority areas, including Environmental Responsibility, Product & Content Safety, Human Rights & Ethical Sourcing and Culture & Human Capital Management, including Diversity & Inclusion.
Building on Our Success and Reaching New Heights
We continue to build and execute innovative, best-in-class CSR & ESG strategies and programs that resonate with our stakeholders and serve Hasbro’s purpose to make the world a better place for all children, fans and families.

Key Areas of Focus
In addition to our efforts on human capital management described below, some key areas of focus for us include the critical importance of environmental responsibility, human rights and ethical sourcing.
•Environmental Responsibility. We recognize the impact our business can have on the environment and are working to reduce our footprint. We view sustainability challenges as opportunities to innovate and to continuously improve our product design and operational efficiencies. The long-term viability and health of our own operations and our supply chain, and the significant potential for environmental improvements, are critical to our business success.
Climate change and its risks are issues we continue to monitor and manage. In addition to initiatives to reduce our energy consumption and improve energy efficiency, we support projects that increase the generation of renewable energy in the marketplace. We continued to meet our renewable energy goal, reaching virtually 100 percent (99.7%) in our owned and operated facilities. To address the greenhouse gases generated by electricity consumption, Hasbro purchases Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) which support the production of renewable energy such as wind, solar, thermal and similar renewable sources, at levels equal to what we use from the public grid. These RECs are bought in and applied to the markets where the energy is used by Hasbro facilities across the globe.
We purchase carbon offsets to address the remaining GHG emissions generated by the use of gas and liquid fuel at our leased and owned facilities, company vehicles, all employee business air travel and the remaining small amount of emissions generated by electricity consumption at our facilities in markets where RECs are not available.
We have also begun to evaluate the climate impacts of our supply chain. In 2019, we began a comprehensive measurement of our supply chain footprint, with virtually 100% of our suppliers participating. Our next step will be to set reduction goals for our suppliers. Hasbro is also currently evaluating the possibility of setting a net zero emissions goal and incorporating corresponding science-based targets.
Other key goals and objectives in this area include:
◦Eliminating virtually all plastic in packaging for new products by the end of 2022.
◦Expanding our industry-first toy recycling program, in partnership with TerraCycle (a leader in product recycling outside of municipal recycling), from the U.S., France, Germany, Brazil, Canada, and the U.K. to additional markets in the European Union.
◦Achieving on an annual basis 100% renewable energy use across owned/operated facilities.
◦Reducing energy consumption by 25%, greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, waste to landfill by 59%, and water consumption by 15%, by the end of 2025.
•Human Rights and Ethical Sourcing. Our Human Rights & Ethical Sourcing program, first launched in 1993, is dedicated to ensuring that facilities involved in the production of our toys and games or licensed consumer products comply with Hasbro’s Global Business Ethics Principles. The program is designed to provide fair and safe working conditions; treat all workers with fairness, dignity and respect; and engage with our suppliers to address safety, health and the environmental impacts of our supply chain. While working on these issues with partners, suppliers, third-party factories and licensees is complex, we remain vigilant in our commitment to ensure workers in our supply chain are treated in accordance with applicable laws and our high ethical standards.
Key goals and objectives in this area include:
◦On an annual basis, achieve 100% social compliance audit rate for all third-party vendor and major sub-contractor facilities, as well as 100% follow-up audit rate for all facilities with pending remediation issues.
◦Requiring third-party factories to participate and complete the Hasbro Ethical Sourcing Academy, a 30-hour, e-learning social compliance course, which trains and reinforces Hasbro’s rigorous ethical sourcing requirements. This mandatory online training is in addition to monthly in-person vendor workshops that the Hasbro Ethical Sourcing team hosts in our sourcing office locations around the world.

Human Capital Management
Overview
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop and retain a talented diverse workforce. The experience, dedication and diverse backgrounds of our employees are at the heart of our success, energizing everything we do, from developing innovative products to creating immersive entertainment experiences. Working together, we seek to create a culture of Community, Creativity, Inclusion, Integrity and Passion in which everyone feels valued and empowered to deliver their best every day. As our organization continues to grow and evolve, we remain steadfast in our ambition to provide a supportive and inclusive community that is the best place our employees ever work.
Employees
As of December 27, 2020, we employed 6,822 people worldwide, with approximately 50% of our employees in the North America (41% in the United States), 27% in Europe, and 17% in Asia Pacific. As of fiscal year end, approximately 55% of our global workforce was female, 42% of our employees in managerial roles (meaning director level and above) were female, and minorities represented approximately 19% of the Company's U.S. workforce, of which 10% of our U.S. employees in managerial roles were minorities. Approximately 10% of our employees are covered by unions or collective bargaining agreements.
Governance
Our governance of human capital starts with our board of directors. The Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the Company policies and practices with respect to significant issues of corporate social responsibility, including aspects of human capital management, such as diversity and inclusion. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our compensation programs.
For corporate social responsibility objectives, our chairman and CEO chairs an internal executive CSR Committee, comprised of senior management and leadership, that sets the strategic direction for CSR policies and initiatives, and ensures their integration throughout the entire global organization. Our corporate CSR team, led by our Chief Purpose Officer, works cross-functionally to develop and implement strategic initiatives across our company and advise on key issues. Additionally, our Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO"), is responsible for developing and executing key aspects of our human capital strategy, including the attraction, acquisition, development and engagement of talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy and the design of competitive compensation and employee benefit programs.
Key Areas of Focus
•Diversity and Inclusion (D&I). We believe that the more inclusive we are as a company, the more effective our employees will be and the stronger our business will perform. Hasbro views D&I as a strategic CSR priority that is linked to the future success of our business and the growth of our brands. In 2018, our Chairman and CEO, Brian Goldner, along with 800 other CEOs, signed on to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge, developed by the accounting firm PwC, to publicly affirm Hasbro’s commitment to D&I as a fundamental value and corporate priority. A summary of some of the significant steps we have taken to further build a culture of D&I within our organization include:
◦Establishing a D&I function responsible for D&I programs and initiatives, talent acquisition and employee engagement.
◦Holding numerous meetings with employees across the U.S., outlining the business case for D&I.
◦Launching a Global Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging program to discuss employee experiences and concerns in the after-math of social unrest.
◦Implementing unconscious bias training to help acknowledge subtle biases, which impact employee and management behavior, from hiring to project team selections and people management.
◦Setting aggressive D&I goals for the organization that include:
▪Increasing the percentage of women in director and above roles globally to 50% by 2025;
23
Table of Contents
▪Expanding ethnically and racially diverse employee representation in the U.S. to 25% by 2025; and
▪Including a 50% diverse slate of candidates for all open U.S. positions where there is underrepresentation.
•Employee Engagement. At Hasbro, we support 12 Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), with nearly 1,000 members, reflecting our diverse employee population and the dynamic opportunities for employee engagement. These groups give voice to member concerns, create opportunities for networking and leadership skills development, aid in employee recruitment and retention efforts, and celebrate ethnic and cultural themes important to our workforce. In addition to our ERGs, we established a Business Resource Group (BRG), which provides a channel for the ERGs to consult on business decisions and programs, many related to diversity, as well as on the marketing, design and content of products.
•Compensation, Health, Safety & Well-being of Employees. Employee attraction, development and retention has long been a key Hasbro priority. We recognize and reward our employees with a total rewards package that includes competitive base pay, equity compensation (for certain levels), annual incentives, product discounts and other comprehensive benefits, including wellness programs that help people integrate work and life commitments. We regularly review salary ratios for men and women in similar roles to help maintain internal equity and market competitiveness across the globe, including among managers. We review both industry and local market data at least annually to identify trends and market gaps in order to maintain the competitiveness of our compensation and employee benefit programs. When designing our compensation and employee benefit programs, we also look beyond the fundamentals of these important components and consider the bigger picture of how these programs contribute to the overall employee experience.
We also realize that employee health and wellness is an important area to be well managed. We support our colleagues’ wellbeing, which includes mental, physical and financial wellness, through a number of programs, including:
◦Employee Wellness & Happiness Teams organized in our major offices that offer wellness programs.
◦Robust employee assistance programs, including virtual therapy sessions, that help employees experiencing stress or other mental health needs.
◦Childcare solutions, including in-home and back-up care, as well as back-up adult and elder care for employees balancing work with childcare or elder care needs.
◦Webinars for managers to help identify risk factors and types of mental health issues.
◦A commitment to flexible work arrangements to help employees with work-life balance and to take care of health needs.
◦Financial wellness resources offered by third party vendors with whom we work that can assist our employees with retirement and other financial planning services.
2020 marked an enormous test of our organization’s resilience, which included adapting to the significant shift to remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of our ongoing commitment to supporting our diverse and geographically dispersed employee population, we issued regular and frequent communications to ensure the health, safety and welfare of our employees. We encourage a continuous dialogue with our employees by inviting their feedback and, as a result, we continue to learn about and respond to their concerns. We provided technological tools, ergonomic support, internet capacity, mental health support and many other tools designed to support our workforce in working effectively in their homes or safely on site, if their jobs so required it. We developed engaging COVID-19 handbooks for employees returning to work in our offices around the world and implemented robust employee health and safety protocols and sanitization in our owned and operated offices and facilities globally. We provided employees with a stipend to help them with expenses relating to remote work. In the U.S., we adopted changes to certain employee benefit plans that were authorized by legislation enacted as a result of COVID-19 to allow greater flexibility and broader coverage to our employees in the event they were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Our employees’ health, safety and well-being during the pandemic is our top priority.
•Training and Talent Development. We are committed to the continued development of our people. Strategic talent reviews and succession planning occur on a planned cadence annually – globally and across all business areas. The CEO and CHRO convene meetings with senior company leadership and the Board of Directors to review top company talent. The Company provides opportunities for the Company's internal
24
Table of Contents
employees to grow their careers. We have programs and training to help develop our employees, such as the Hasbro Management Academy, a global program for managers that identifies and describes what it takes to be an effective leader at Hasbro. We invest in the development of our employees by providing both in-house training and opportunities to participate in third party programs, including both specialized training and broader academic pursuits.
•Community. The power of service is core to our employee culture. Employees have the benefit of taking four hours of paid time off every month to volunteer with programs and organizations that benefit children. In addition, team-building company-sponsored volunteer projects are organized throughout the year allowing groups of employees to make a meaningful difference in the community through service. These programs include our Global Day of Joy, Hasbro’s annual company-wide day of service. Every year in December, employees from each Hasbro office around the world participate in service projects to benefit child-focused organizations. In 2020, approximately 5,200 employees around the world completed more than 14,000 service hours to make a difference for more than 100,000 children.
Trademarks, Copyrights and Patents
We seek to protect our products, for the most part, and in as many countries as practical, through registered trademarks, copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available, cost effective, and meaningful. The loss of such rights concerning any particular product is unlikely to result in significant harm to our business, although the loss of such protection for a number of significant items might have such an effect.
Government Regulation
Our toy and game products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of The Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, (as amended, the “CPSIA”), The Federal Hazardous Substances Act (the “FHSA”), The Flammable Fabrics Act (the “FFA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, a few of our products, such as the food mixes for our EASY-BAKE ovens, are also subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration.
The CPSIA empowers the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) to take action against hazards presented by consumer products, including the formulation and implementation of regulations and uniform safety standards. The CPSC has the authority to seek to declare a product “a banned hazardous substance” under the CPSIA and to ban it from commerce. The CPSC can file an action to seize and condemn an “imminently hazardous consumer product” under the CPSIA and may also order equitable remedies such as recall, replacement, repair or refund for the product. The FHSA provides for the repurchase by the manufacturer of articles that are banned.
Consumer product safety laws also exist in some states and cities within the United States and in many international markets including Canada, Australia and Europe. We utilize independent third party laboratories that employ testing and other procedures intended to maintain compliance with the CPSIA, the FHSA, the FFA, other applicable domestic and international product standards, and our own standards. Any material product recall or other safety issue impacting our products could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, depending on the product and scope of the recall, could damage our reputation and could negatively affect sales of our other products as well.
The Children’s Television Act of 1990 and the rules and regulations of the United States Federal Communications Commission, the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the laws of certain other countries, also place limitations on television commercials during children’s programming and on advertising in other forms to children, and on the collection of information from children, such as restrictions on collecting information from children under the age of thirteen subject to the provisions of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.
In addition to laws restricting the collection of information from children, our business is subject to other regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation which became effective in the European Union in May 2018, which restricts the collection, use, and retention of personal information. Failure to comply with any of those restrictions can subject us to severe liabilities.
Further we maintain programs to comply with various United States federal, state, local and international requirements relating to the environment, health, safety and other matters.
Our Canadian television and film operations benefit from certain funding and tax credits for certain productions in Canada. To continue to avail ourselves of these benefits, we plan to comply with applicable regulations and directives of the Investment Canada Act and the Minister of Canadian Heritage.

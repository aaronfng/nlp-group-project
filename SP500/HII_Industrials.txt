History and Organization

Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. ("HII", the "Company", "we", "us", or "our") is America’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry. For more than a century, our Ingalls Shipbuilding segment ("Ingalls") in Mississippi and Newport News Shipbuilding segment ("Newport News") in Virginia have built more ships in more ship classes than any other U.S. naval shipbuilder. Our Technical Solutions segment provides a range of services to the governmental and energy markets.

We conduct most of our business with the U.S. Government, primarily the Department of Defense ("DoD"). As prime contractor, principal subcontractor, team member, or partner, we participate in many high-priority U.S. defense programs. Ingalls includes our non-nuclear ship design, construction, repair, and maintenance businesses. Newport News includes all of our nuclear ship design, construction, overhaul, refueling, and repair and maintenance businesses. We also provide a wide range of professional services, including defense and federal solutions ("DFS"), nuclear and environmental, and unmanned systems, through our Technical Solutions segment. Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, we employ approximately 42,000 people both domestically and internationally.

Ingalls
 
Through our Ingalls segment, we design and construct non-nuclear ships for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, including amphibious assault ships, expeditionary warfare ships, surface combatants, and national security cutters ("NSC"). We are the sole builder of amphibious assault ships and one of two builders of surface combatants for the U.S. Navy. We are the sole builder of large multi-mission NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. Our Ingalls segment is located in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 800 acres along the Pascagoula River. This shipyard offers a collection of manufacturing capabilities that includes a 660-ton gantry crane and a Land Based Test Facility.

Amphibious Assault Ships
We construct amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, which include the U.S. Navy large deck amphibious assault ships ("LHA") and amphibious transport dock ships ("LPD"), respectively. The LHA is a key component of the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps requirement for 11 Expeditionary Strike Groups/Amphibious Readiness Groups, and design, construction, and modernization of LHAs are core to our Ingalls operations. In 2007, we were awarded the construction contract for USS America (LHA 6), the first in a class of enhanced amphibious assault ships designed from the keel up to be an aviation optimized Marine assault platform. We delivered USS Tripoli (LHA 7) in 2020 and are currently constructing Bougainville (LHA 8).
The LPD program is a long-running production program of expeditionary warfare ships in which we have generated efficiencies through ship-over-ship learning. We delivered USS Portland (LPD 27) in 2017 and USS John P. Murtha (LPD 26) in 2016, and we are currently constructing Fort Lauderdale (LPD 28), Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29), and Harrisburg (LPD 30). In 2020, we were awarded a contract to construct Pittsburgh (LPD 31).

Surface Combatants
We are a design agent for, and one of only two companies that constructs, the Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) guided missile destroyers, a class of surface combatant. We have delivered 32 Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers to the U.S. Navy, including Delbert D. Black (DDG 119) in 2020 and Paul Ignatius (DDG 117) in 2019. In 2013, we were awarded a multi-year contract totaling $3.3 billion for construction of five Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers, of which two have been delivered. We are currently constructing the remaining three ships: Frank E. Petersen Jr. (DDG 121), Lenah H. Sutcliffe Higbee (DDG 123), and Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125). In 2018, we were awarded a multi-year contract totaling $5.1 billion for construction of six additional Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers. In 2020, we were awarded a contract to construct an additional Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyer.

National Security Cutters
The U.S. Coast Guard's recapitalization program is designed to replace aging and operationally expensive ships and aircraft used to conduct missions in excess of 50 miles from the shoreline. The flagship of this program is the Legend class NSC, a multi-mission platform we designed and continue to build. We delivered USCGC Kimball (NSC 7), USCGC Midgett (NSC 8), and USCGC Stone (NSC 9) to the U.S. Coast Guard in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively. In 2018, we were awarded long-lead-time material and construction contracts for Calhoun (NSC 10) and Friedman (NSC 11), which are currently under construction.

Newport News

The core business of our Newport News segment is designing and constructing nuclear-powered ships, such as aircraft carriers and submarines, and the refueling and overhaul and the inactivation of such ships. Our Newport News shipyard is located on approximately 550 acres near the mouth of the James River, which adjoins the Chesapeake Bay. The shipyard has two miles of waterfront property and heavy industrial facilities, which include seven graving docks, a floating dry dock, two outfitting berths, five outfitting piers, module outfitting facilities, and various other workshops. Our Newport News shipyard also has a 2,170-foot dry dock serviced by a 1,050-ton gantry crane capable of supporting two aircraft carriers at one time.
 
Design, Construction, Refueling and Complex Overhaul, and Inactivation of Aircraft Carriers

Engineering, design, and construction of U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carriers ("CVN") are core to Newport News operations. Aircraft carriers are the largest ships in the U.S. Navy's fleet, with a displacement of over 90,000 tons. Newport News has designed and built more than 31 aircraft carriers for the U.S. Navy since 1933, including all ten Nimitz class (CVN 68) aircraft carriers currently in active service, as well as the first ship of the next generation Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers.
 
We delivered the U.S. Navy's newest carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), in 2017. Beginning in 2009, we received contract awards totaling $7.7 billion for construction preparation, detail design, and construction of the second Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carrier, John F. Kennedy (CVN 79). In addition, we have received awards valued at $15.2 billion for detail design and construction of the Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers Enterprise (CVN 80) and Doris Miller (CVN 81).
We continue to be the exclusive prime contractor for nuclear aircraft carrier refueling and complex overhaul ("RCOH"). Each RCOH takes nearly four years to complete, with the work accounting for approximately 35% of all maintenance and modernization during an aircraft carrier's 50 year service life. RCOH services include propulsion work (refueling of reactors; propulsion plant modernization; and propulsion plant repairs), restoration of service life (dry docking, tank, and void maintenance; hull, shafting, propellers, and rudders; launch and recovery system; piping repairs; and component refurbishment), and modernization (electrical systems; aviation support systems; warfare; interoperability; and environmental compliance). We provide ongoing maintenance services for the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier fleet through both RCOH and fleet support across the globe.

In 2017, we completed the RCOH for USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) and redelivered the ship to the U.S. Navy. We are currently performing the RCOH of USS George Washington (CVN 73). We believe our position as the exclusive designer and builder of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our RCOH performance on the first six Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers, our highly trained workforce, the capital-intensive nature of RCOH work, and high barriers to entry due to its nuclear component strongly position us for RCOH contract awards on the remaining Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers, as well as future work on Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers.

We received a contract in 2013 to inactivate the decommissioned Enterprise (CVN 65), the world's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which was built by us and commissioned in 1961. The decommissioned Enterprise (CVN 65) inactivation was completed in the second quarter of 2018. Aircraft carriers have a lifespan of approximately 50 years, and we believe the ten Nimitz class (CVN 68) carriers we delivered that are currently in active service, as well as Gerald R. Ford class (CVN 78) aircraft carriers we will deliver in the future, present significant opportunities for inactivation contracts as they reach the end of their lifespans. We believe we are well positioned as the U.S. Navy's shipyard of choice for these contract awards.

Design and Construction of Nuclear-Powered Submarines
We are one of only two companies in the United States capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. Newport News has delivered 62 submarines to the U.S. Navy since 1960, comprised of 48 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News. Our nuclear submarine program, located at our Newport News shipyard, includes construction, engineering, design, research, and integrated planning.

Virginia Class (SSN 774) Submarines

We have a teaming agreement with Electric Boat Corporation ("Electric Boat"), a division of General Dynamics Corporation ("General Dynamics"), to build Virginia class (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines cooperatively. Under the teaming arrangement, we build the stern, habitability and machinery spaces, torpedo room, sail, and bow, while Electric Boat builds the engine room, control room, and pressure hull structure. Work on the reactor plant and the final assembly, test, outfit, and delivery of the submarines to the U.S. Navy alternates between Electric Boat and us.

The four submarines of the first block and six submarines of the second block of Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines have been delivered. In 2008, the team was awarded a construction contract for the third block of eight Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines. The multi-year contract increased construction from one submarine per year to two submarines per year. The first submarine under this contract was delivered in 2014 and the last submarine of the third block was delivered in 2019. In 2014, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fourth block of ten Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines. The first submarine of the Block IV contract was delivered in 2020, and the last is scheduled for delivery in 2024. In 2019, the team was awarded a construction contract for the fifth block of nine Virginia class (SSN 774) submarines, continuing the two submarines per year production rate that began on the third block. The fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act included funding to add another submarine to the fifth block that was not included in the initial contract award. The first submarine of the Block V contract is scheduled for delivery in 2025 and the last is scheduled for delivery in 2030.

Columbia Class (SSBN 826) Submarines

Newport News is participating in design and construction of the Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine as a replacement for the current aging Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines ("SSBN"), which were first introduced into service in 1981. The Ohio class SSBN includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines ("SSGN"). The Columbia class (SSBN 826) program currently anticipates 12 new ballistic missile submarines. We perform design work as a subcontractor to Electric Boat, and we have entered into a teaming agreement with Electric Boat to build modules for the entire Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine program that leverages our Virginia class (SSN 774) experience. We were previously awarded contracts from Electric Boat to begin integrated product and process development and provide long–lead-time material and advance construction for the Columbia class (SSBN 826) program. Contract award for the first two Columbia class submarines (SSBN 826 and SSBN 827) and construction start of the first Columbia class (SSBN 826) submarine occurred in late 2020.

Naval Nuclear Support Services

Newport News provides additional services to and in support of the U.S. Navy, ranging from services supporting the Navy's carrier and submarine fleets to maintenance services at U.S. Navy training facilities. Fleet services include design, construction, maintenance, and disposal activities for in service U.S. Navy nuclear ships worldwide through mobile and in-house capabilities. We also provide maintenance services on nuclear reactor prototypes, such as those at the Kenneth A. Kesselring Site, a research and development facility in New York that supports the U.S. Navy.
Technical Solutions

We established our Technical Solutions segment to enhance strategic and operational alignment among our services businesses. The Technical Solutions segment includes businesses that are focused on life-cycle sustainment services to the U.S. Navy fleet and other maritime customers; high-end information technology (“IT”) and mission-based solutions for DoD, intelligence, and federal civilian customers; and nuclear management and operations and environmental management services for the Department of Energy ("DoE"), DoD, state and local
3

governments, and private sector companies. In July 2020, we announced changes to the organization and alignment within our Technical Solutions segment. Following a series of strategic acquisitions and major contract awards, coupled with a review of existing capabilities and the segment's organizational structure, Technical Solutions reconstituted its internal organization to better serve existing and future customers while achieving support function efficiencies. Following the reorganization, the Technical Solutions segment is comprised of three business units as follows.

Defense and Federal Solutions (“DFS”)

DFS is focused on solving national security challenges for the DoD, the intelligence community, and federal civilian agencies around the globe. The group’s expertise includes maritime fleet sustainment; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; cyber operations; secure enterprise information technology engineering and operations; advanced modeling, simulation, and training; and logistics management.

Nuclear and Environmental Services

Our nuclear and environmental services focus on nuclear management and operations. We provide site management, nuclear and industrial facilities operations and maintenance, decontamination and decommissioning, and radiological and hazardous waste management services to DoE, DoD, state and local governments, and private sector companies. As part of our nuclear and environmental services, we participate in joint ventures, including Newport News Nuclear BWXT Los Alamos, LLC ("N3B"), Mission Support and Test Services, LLC ("MSTS"), and Savannah River Nuclear Solutions, LLC ("SRNS"). We have a 51% ownership interest in N3B, which, in 2017, was awarded the Los Alamos Legacy Cleanup Contract at the DoE/National Nuclear Security Administration’s Los Alamos National Laboratory located northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico. We have a 23% ownership interest in MSTS, which, in 2017, was awarded a contract for site management and operations at the Nevada National Security Site located northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. We have a 34% ownership interest in SRNS, which provides site management and operations at the DoE's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.

Unmanned Systems

Our unmanned systems products and services create advanced unmanned maritime solutions for defense, marine research, and commercial applications. Serving customers in more than 30 countries, unmanned systems provides design, autonomy, manufacturing, testing, operations, and sustainment of unmanned systems, including unmanned underwater vehicles and unmanned surface vessels.

Corporate

HII became an independent, publicly owned company in 2011, when we were spun-off from Northrop Grumman. Our principal executive offices are located at 4101 Washington Avenue, Newport News, Virginia 23607. Our telephone number is (757) 380-2000, and our home page on the Internet is www.huntingtoningalls.com. References to our website in this report are provided as a convenience and do not constitute, and should not be viewed as, incorporation by reference of the information contained on, or available through, the website. Accordingly, such information should not be considered part of this report.

Customers

Our revenues are primarily derived from the U.S. Government, including the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, the DoD, the DoE and other federal agencies. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, approximately 88%, 87%, and 88%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from the U.S. Navy.

Intellectual Property

We develop and incorporate into our vessels new technologies, manufacturing processes, and systems-integration processes. In addition to owning intellectual property, we license intellectual property rights to and from other parties. The U.S. Government receives non-exclusive licenses to our intellectual property developed in the performance of U.S. Government contracts and unlimited license rights in technical data developed under our U.S. Government contracts when such data is developed entirely at government expense. The U.S. Government may use or authorize other parties to use the intellectual property we license to the government. While our intellectual property rights are important to our operations, we do not believe that any existing patent, license, or other
4

intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material impact on our business.

Seasonality

No material portion of our business is seasonal. The timing of our revenue recognition is based on several factors, including the timing of contract awards, the incurrence of contract costs, contract cost estimation, and unit deliveries. See Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates, and Judgments - Revenue Recognition in Item 7.

Backlog

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total backlog was approximately $46.0 billion and $46.5 billion, respectively. We expect approximately 17% of backlog at December 31, 2020, to be converted into sales in 2021.

Raw Materials
The most significant material we use is steel. Other materials we use in large quantities include paint, aluminum, pipe, electrical cable, and fittings. All of these materials are currently available in adequate supply. In connection with our U.S. Government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials and component parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. For long-term contracts, we generally solicit price quotations for many of our material requirements from multiple suppliers to ensure competitive pricing. While we have not generally been dependent upon any one supply source, we currently have only one supplier for certain component parts as a result of consolidation in the defense industry. We believe these single source suppliers, as well as our overall supplier base, are adequate to meet our foreseeable needs. We have mitigated some supply risk by negotiating long-term agreements with certain raw material suppliers. In addition, we have mitigated price risk related to raw material purchases through certain contractual arrangements with customers.

Governmental Regulation and Supervision

We operate in heavily regulated markets and must comply with a variety of laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts, as well as legal and regulatory requirements affecting cyber security, environmental protection, and our nuclear operations. Government contracting requirements increase our contract performance costs and compliance costs and risks. See Risk Factors in Item 1A.

We are overseen and audited by the U.S. Government and its agencies, including the U.S. Navy's Supervisor of Shipbuilding, the Defense Contract Audit Agency ("DCAA"), and the Defense Contract Management Agency ("DCMA"). These agencies evaluate our contract performance, cost structures, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of our business systems and processes relative to U.S. Government requirements. Our business systems subject to audit or review include our accounting systems, purchasing systems, government property management systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems, and material management accounting systems. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to administrative, civil, or criminal proceedings, which could result in fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory, treble, or other damages. Certain U.S. Government findings against a contractor can also lead to suspension or debarment from future U.S. Government contracts or the loss of export privileges. In addition, any costs we incur that are determined to be unallowable or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be recovered or must be refunded if already reimbursed.

The U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold contract payments if it determines significant deficiencies exist in one or more of our business systems. The U.S. Government has, in certain instances, withheld contract payments upon its assessment that deficiencies exist with one or more of our business systems. Although this has not materially impacted the timing of our cash receipts in the past, any such action by the U.S. Government in the future could have a material impact on the timing of our cash receipts.

The U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, in whole or in part, with little or no prior notice, for convenience or for default based upon performance. In the event of termination of a contract for convenience, a contractor is normally able to recover costs already incurred on the contract and profit on those costs up to the amount authorized under the contract, but not the remaining profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Such a termination could also result in the cancellation of future work on the related program. A
5

termination resulting from our default could expose us to various liabilities, including excess re-procurement costs, and could have a material effect on our ability to compete for future contracts.

Our contracts with the U.S. Government may result in Requests for Equitable Adjustments ("REAs"), which represent requests for the U.S. Government to make appropriate adjustments to contract terms, including pricing, delivery schedule, technical requirements, or other affected terms, due to changes in the original contract requirements and resulting delays and disruption in contract performance for which the U.S. Government is responsible. We submit and negotiate REAs in the ordinary course of business, and large REAs are not uncommon at the conclusion of both new construction and RCOH activities. REAs are not considered claims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, although they may be converted to such claims if we cannot reach agreement with the U.S. Government.
In cases where there are multiple suppliers, contracts for the construction and conversion of U.S. Navy ships and submarines are generally subject to competitive bidding. In evaluating proposed prices, the U.S. Navy sometimes requires bidders to submit information on pricing, estimated costs of completion, and anticipated profit margins to enable the Navy to assess cost realism. The U.S. Navy uses this information and other data to determine an estimated cost for each bidder. U.S. Government regulations determine contractor costs that are allowable and therefore recoverable from the government, and certain costs are not allowable and therefore are not recoverable. The U.S. Government also regulates the methods by which allowable costs, including overhead, are allocated to government contracts.
Our business, including contracts with U.S. Government agencies and subcontracts with other prime contractors, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation ("FAR"), the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement ("DFARS"), the Truth in Negotiations Act, the Procurement Integrity Act, the False Claims Act, U.S. Cost Accounting Standards ("CAS"), the International Traffic in Arms Regulations promulgated under the Arms Export Control Act, the Close the Contractor Fraud Loophole Act, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A noncompliance determination by a government agency may result in reductions in contract values, contract modifications or terminations, penalties, fines, repayments, compensatory, treble, or other damages, or suspension or debarment. We are also subject to evolving cyber security and data privacy and protection laws and regulations, which increase compliance risks and costs and may affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines and other penalties.

Environmental Compliance

Our manufacturing operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. We accrue estimated costs to perform environmental remediation when we determine it is probable we will incur expenses in the future, in amounts we can reasonably estimate, to address environmental conditions at currently or formerly owned or leased operating facilities, or at sites where we are named a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") or similarly designated by another environmental agency. The inherent difficulties in estimating future environmental remediation costs, resulting from uncertainties regarding the extent of required remediation, determination of legally responsible parties, and the status of laws and regulations and their interpretations, can cause our estimated remediation costs to change.

We assess the potential impact on our financial statements of future environmental remediation costs by estimating, on a site-by-site basis, the range of reasonably possible remediation costs that we could incur, taking into account currently available information at each site, the current state of technology, and our prior experience remediating contaminated sites. We review our estimates periodically and adjust them to reflect changes in facts, technology, and legal circumstances. We record accruals for environmental remediation costs on an undiscounted basis in the accounting period in which it becomes probable we have incurred a liability and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We record related insurance recoveries only when we determine that collection is probable, and we do not include any litigation costs related to environmental matters in our environmental remediation accrual.

We either expense or capitalize environmental expenditures as appropriate. Capitalized expenditures relate to long-lived improvements in current operating facilities. We accrue environmental remediation costs at sites involving multiple parties based upon our expected share of liability, taking into account the financial viability of other jointly liable parties. We may incur remediation costs exceeding our accrued amount if other PRPs do not pay their allocable share of remediation costs, which could have a material effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

6

As of December 31, 2020, our probable estimable future costs for environmental remediation were immaterial. In addition, we cannot reasonably estimate remediation costs at certain of our potential environmental remediation sites. Although information gained as remediation progresses may materially affect our accrued liability, we do not anticipate that future remediation expenditures will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
We believe we are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and historical environmental compliance costs have not been material to our business. We could be affected by new environmental laws or regulations, including any laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment, or natural resources. We have made investments we believe are necessary to comply with environmental laws, but we expect to incur future capital and operating costs to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations. We do not currently believe such costs will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Our nuclear operations are subject to various safety related requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In the event of noncompliance, these agencies may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines, or shut down our operations, depending on their assessment of the severity of the noncompliance. In addition, new or revised security and safety requirements imposed by the U.S. Navy, the DoE, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures.
Subject to certain requirements and limitations, our contracts with the U.S. Navy and the DoE generally provide for indemnity by the U.S. Government for losses resulting from our nuclear operations. For our commercial nuclear operations, we rely primarily on insurance carried by nuclear facility operators for risk mitigation, and we maintain limited insurance coverage for losses in excess of the coverage of facility operators.

Competition

In our primary business of designing, building, overhauling, and repairing military ships, we primarily compete with General Dynamics and, in the case of certain shipbuilding programs, smaller shipyards. The smaller shipyards sometimes team with large defense contractors. Intense competition related to programs, resources, funding, and long operating cycles are key characteristics of both our business and the shipbuilding defense industry in general. It is common industry practice to share work on major programs among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another party, become a subcontractor for the prime contracting party. It is not uncommon to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, serve as a supplier to or a customer of such competitor on other contracts. The nature of major defense programs, conducted under binding long-term contracts, allows companies that perform well to benefit from a level of program continuity not common in many industries.

We believe we are well-positioned in our markets. Because we are the only company currently capable of building, refueling, and inactivating the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we believe we are in a strong competitive position to be awarded each contract to perform such activities. Even so, the government periodically revisits whether refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers should be performed in private or public facilities. If a U.S. Government owned shipyard were to become capable and engaged in the refueling of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, our market position could be significantly and adversely affected.

While we have competed with another large defense contractor to build large deck amphibious ships, we are currently the only builder of large deck amphibious assault ships and expeditionary warfare ships for the U.S. Navy, including LHAs and LPDs. We are also the sole builder of NSCs for the U.S. Coast Guard. We are one of only two companies currently designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy, and we are party to long-term teaming agreements with the other company for the production of both Virginia class (SSN 774) fast attack nuclear submarines and Columbia class (SSBN 826) ballistic missile submarines. We are one of only two companies that builds the U.S. Navy's current fleet of Arleigh Burke class (DDG 51) destroyers and are strongly positioned to be awarded future contracts for these types of ships as well.

Our success in the shipbuilding defense industry depends upon our ability to develop, market, and produce our products and services at costs consistent with the U.S. Navy's budget, as well as our ability to provide the workforce, technologies, facilities, equipment, and financial capacity needed to deliver those products and services with maximum efficiency.

7

We compete with a variety of companies in the provision of services to the government and energy markets.

Human Capital Resources

HII recognizes that our employees are our most important assets and serve as the foundation for our ability to achieve financial and strategic objectives. Our employees are critical to driving operational execution, meeting customer expectations, providing strong financial performance, advancing innovation, and maintaining a strong quality and compliance program. Our leaders believe each employee contributes to our success.
We have approximately 42,000 employees. We are the largest industrial employer in Virginia and the largest private employer in Mississippi. We employ individuals specializing in 19 crafts and trades, with approximately 6,700 engineers and designers and approximately 2,800 employees with advanced degrees. Our workforce contains many third-, fourth-, and fifth-generation employees, and approximately 1,500 employees with more than 40 years of continuous service. Employees in our shipbuilding segments with more than 40 years of continuous service achieve the honor of “Master Shipbuilder.” As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,281 Master Shipbuilders at Newport News and 226 at Ingalls. We also employ more than 6,500 veterans across the enterprise.

In addition, over 1,100 apprentices are enrolled in more than 27 crafts and advanced programs at our two shipbuilding divisions. From nuclear pipe welders to senior executives, we employ approximately 4,400 apprentice school alumni, comprised of 3,100 at Newport News and 1,350 at Ingalls.

Approximately 50% of our employees are covered by a total of eight collective bargaining agreements and one site stabilization agreement. Newport News has three collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, which expire in November 2021, December 2022, and April 2024.The collective bargaining agreement that expires in November 2021 covers approximately 50% of Newport News employees. Newport News craft workers employed at the Kesselring Site near Saratoga Springs, New York are represented under an indefinite DoE site agreement. Ingalls has five collective bargaining agreements covering represented employees, all of which expire in March 2022. Approximately 25 Technical Solutions employees at various locations are represented by unions and perform work under collective bargaining agreements.

We have not experienced a work stoppage in more than 21 years at NNS and more than 13 years at Ingalls. We are committed to working effectively with our existing unions and believe our relationship with our represented employees is satisfactory.

The success and growth of our business depends in large part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop a skilled and diverse workforce of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. To succeed in the markets in which we compete for labor, we have developed key workforce development, recruitment, and retention strategies and objectives that we focus on as part of the overall management of our business. These strategies and objectives form the pillars of our human capital management framework and are advanced through the following programs, policies, and initiatives:

Competitive Pay and Benefits - Our compensation programs are designed to ensure we have the ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees to achieve our objectives.
•We provide employee base wages and salaries that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location.
•We utilize nationally recognized surveys and outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our employee and executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry.
•The structure of our executive compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance, and we align our executive long-term equity compensation metrics with long-term shareholder interests.
•Employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, 401(k) plans, and life and disability/accident insurance coverage. We also offer a variety of benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including: annual leave/paid time off; paid holidays, flexible work arrangements/schedules; telemedicine; parental leave; transgender medical coverage; and a wellness program that includes physical, mental, and financial wellness components. We also fund the operation of Family Health Centers near our two shipyards, which provide a full range of medical, lab, pharmacy, dental, physical therapy, and vision services.

8

Recruitment, Training, and Workforce Development - Our three segments hire thousands of employees each year. In 2020, we hired more than 6,000 new employees. To help us meet this large demand for talent, we have worked to create, develop, and maintain multiple talent pipelines. One of the key components of our approach to workforce development is to “grow our own”. We operate two apprentice schools, one at Ingalls and one at Newport News. The Newport News Apprentice School was founded in 1919, and the Ingalls Apprentice School was founded in 1952.

The two apprentice schools combined have graduated over 14,000 graduates since their inceptions. The schools are nationally renowned and are critical to training both our craft/trades and technical workforces, as well as developing the future leaders of our company. The Ingalls Apprentice School has partnered with the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College to permit their apprentices to earn credits toward an associate’s degree. The Newport News Apprentice School has partnered with two community colleges, as well as Old Dominion University, to enable apprentices to earn a bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Modeling & Simulation.

In addition to operating our own apprentice schools, we have developed and nurtured multiple partnerships with state and local governments, pre-k education providers, primary/secondary school districts, community colleges, and four-year colleges and universities, as well as post-graduate institutions. We also make significant investments through monetary contributions, leadership time, and employee volunteer hours to support these critical partnerships.

We maintain effective partnerships with colleges and universities, military bases for transitioning veterans, and regional community colleges to enable us to recruit and hire engineering, IT, and other technical talent. Working closely with state and local government leaders, we have successfully facilitated local, regional, and state-wide workforce development and education initiatives that include pre-K programs, high school trades programs/talent development labs, pre-hire trades/technical community college programs, interns/co-ops with colleges and universities, adult trades programs, veterans and military spouses training programs, and unemployed/underemployed training programs.

We view our workforce development process as a “leadership factory” and have developed a robust and effective succession planning process that ensures continuity in our leadership ranks. Since our founding in 2011, we have followed our succession plans 80% of the time when replacing a vacancy in an existing vice president position, and we have filled 75% of newly created vice president positions with internal hires.

Environmental, Health & Safety (“EH&S”) - The health, safety, and well-being of our employees, together with protection of the environment in the communities in which we operate, is one of our core values and rooted in our culture across the enterprise. We prioritize, manage, and carefully track safety performance and integrate sound environmental, safety, and health practices to make a meaningful difference in every facet of our operations, particularly at our shipbuilding segments and at DoE sites on which Technical Solutions segment employees work.
Safety goals are included in operational metrics for purposes of the Newport News and Ingalls compensation programs. We also use a wide variety of training courses, pre-job “Take Five” crew talks, medical surveillance programs, and employee involvement efforts to keep our workforce focused on EH&S. At Newport News and Ingalls, a key component of our EH&S program is the utilization of health and safety teams, which are comprised of production and maintenance employees and front-line managers whose goal is to educate, engage, and empower our workforce toward a culture that strives to reduce injury, illness, and environmental impacts. We employ programs focused on identifying, reporting, and abating near misses and other programs that aim to recognize, evaluate, and control hazards.

During 2020, we tracked several metrics related to occupational injuries as one of several methods to monitor our safety performance. One of the key metrics is Total Case Rate (“TCR”), which is the number of Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") recordable injuries per 100 equivalent employees. The TCR for Newport News was 4.77 in 2020, compared to 4.67 in 2019, and the TCR at Ingalls was 6.35 in 2020, compared to 6.59 in 2019. Newport News also tracks Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (“DART”), which is the number of OSHA recordable cases in which the employee is unable to work, cannot work due to a restriction, or can work with a restriction as a result of an injury per 100 equivalent employees. DART at Newport News was 3.41 in 2020, compared to 3.01 in 2019. Ingalls tracks two other safety metrics: Lost Time Case Rate (“LTCR”), which is the number of employees that lost work time per 100 employees, and Lost Work Day Rate (“LWDR”), which is the number of lost workdays per

100 full-time employees. The LTCR and LWDR at Ingalls were 2.53 and 56.37, respectively, in 2020 and 2.39 and 56.82, respectively, in 2019.

We also track the number of implemented safety improvements year over year. We implemented over 2,300 safety improvements in 2020, compared to more than 1,800 in 2019.

In connection with the outbreak of COVID-19, the DoD designated Newport News and Ingalls as critical infrastructure industry. Our production and support workforce therefore continued in-person work at our facilities to provide vital products and services to our government customers, while many of our employees in support and administrative functions have effectively worked remotely since mid-March 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, less than 400 of our employees regularly worked remotely, and at our peak, more than 11,300 employees were working remotely.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related mitigation measures, we implemented changes in March 2020 to protect our employees and customers and support appropriate health and safety protocols. For example, we began temperature screening and on-site testing for COVID-19 for employees entering our shipyards, implemented extensive cleaning and sanitation processes for our shops, ships, and offices, re-engineered how some work was performed in order to support social distancing requirements, and implemented broad work-from-home initiatives for employees in our support and administrative functions.
Corporate Values - We operate on a set of values that are shared with all employees: Integrity, Safety, Respect, Engagement, Responsibility, and Performance. "Always doing the right thing" is an essential belief at HII. That tone starts at the top and permeates through the culture of the company. It is a set of core values, standards, and behaviors that guide employee commitment to the highest ethical standards and serves as the underlying framework for all of our human capital strategies.

Advancing and Celebrating Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”) - We believe we gain a key competitive advantage by building a workforce community that values contributions and perspectives from a variety of backgrounds, skills, and experiences regardless of race, ethnicity, color, religion, sex, disability, nationality, or other differentiation, and our leaders leverage the differences within their teams. We also believe D&I is vital to our ability to grow and innovate in an ever-changing, fast-paced environment. Our diverse and inclusive workplace encourages different perspectives and ideas, which we believe enables better business decisions. The following are highlights of our D&I program:
•Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) are a key component of our corporate culture and an important part of our diversity and inclusion strategy. We currently sponsor 15 ERG’s, which are employee-led and open to all employees, including: African American Shipbuilders Association, Asian & Pacific Islander Shipbuilding Association, Generational Integration Focus Team, Hispanic Outreach & Leadership Alliance, Women in Shipbuilding Enterprise, Ingalls Shipbuilders Equality Alliance, Shipbuilders Together Realizing Inclusion, Diversity and Equality, and the Veterans Employee Resource Group.
•We have established D&I Councils at our Corporate Office and at each of our three segments, which provide strategic direction, guidance, and advocacy for our D&I initiatives and advancements. These councils are led by senior executives and include high-performing employees and leaders from across our enterprise.
•We have a long history of participation in a number of annual national diversity conferences, including Black Engineer of the Year Awards, Society of Hispanic Engineers and Professionals, Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers, Society of Women Engineers, Great Minds in STEM, Hispanic Engineers National Achievement Award Conference, Women of Color STEM Conference, and the National Society of Black Engineers Convention. These events provide recruitment, recognition, and development opportunities for our diverse workforce.

Employee Engagement - Since 2006, we have conducted an annual anonymous engagement survey of our workforce, both non-represented and represented. Administered and analyzed by an independent third-party, the survey results are reviewed by our executive team and other senior leaders at our three segments. The results of this engagement survey are also shared with individual managers and employees, who are then tasked with discussing the results with their teams and working together to set goals and implement actions to improve employee engagement and performance. Over 79% of our workforce participated in the 2020 engagement survey. We believe that, at the individual employee level, engagement is about taking ownership of your work and work processes. At the enterprise level, engagement is about creating an inclusive and highly collaborative culture where we all care about and encourage each other’s success, and supporting the opportunity to create more value and transform our business for the future.

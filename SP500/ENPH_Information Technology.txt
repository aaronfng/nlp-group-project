COVID-19 update
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) continues to cause disruptions and uncertainties, including in the core markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed the movement of people, goods and services and had a notable impact on general economic conditions including but not limited to the temporary closures of many businesses, “shelter in place” orders and other governmental regulations, and reduced consumer spending. The most significant near-term impacts of COVID-19 on our financial performance are a decline in sales orders as future residential and commercial system owners are canceling sales meetings with system installation professionals or postponing system installations. As the purchase of new solar energy management solutions declines as part of the impact of COVID-19 on consumer spending, many businesses through which we distribute our products are working at limited operational capacity. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our future operational and financial performance will depend on various future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, duration of employees working remotely, impact on our customers, effect on our sales cycles or costs, and effect on our supply chain and vendors, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, but which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further information relating to the risks and uncertainties related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may be found in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Industry Background
Historically, traditional central inverters were the only inverter technology used for solar photovoltaic (“PV”) installations. In an installation consisting of a traditional central inverter, the solar PV modules are connected in series strings. In a large installation, there are multiple series strings connected in parallel. The aggregated voltage from each of these strings is then fed into a large central inverter. We believe that traditional central inverters have a number of design and performance challenges limiting innovation and their ability to reduce the cost of solar power systems, including the following:
•Productivity limits. If solar modules are wired using a traditional central inverter—group or “string” of modules are wired in series, and an entire string’s output is limited by the output of the lowest-performing module. Because of its string design, there is a single point of failure risk with the traditional central inverter approach.
•Reliability issues. Traditional central inverters are the single most common component of solar installations to fail, resulting in system downtime and adversely impacting total energy output. As a result, central inverters typically carry warranties of only 5 to 10 years.
•Complex design and installation requirements. The central inverter-based solar PV installation requires greater effort on the part of the installer, both in terms of design and on-site labor. Central inverter installations require string design and calculations for safe and reliable operation, as well as specialized equipment such as DC combiners, conduits and disconnects. In addition, the use of high-voltage direct current (“DC”) requires specialized knowledge and training and safety precautions to install central inverter technology.
•Lack of monitoring. The majority of solar installations with central inverter technology offer limited monitoring capabilities. If a module in a central inverter system fails or is not performing to specification, the resulting loss of energy can go unnoticed for an extended period of time.

•Safety issues. Central inverter solar PV installations have a wide distribution of high-voltage (600 volts to 1,000 volts) DC wiring. If damaged, DC wires can generate sustained electrical arcs, reaching temperatures of more than 5,000 °F. This creates the risk of fire for solar PV installation owners and injury for installers and maintenance personnel.
These challenges of traditional central inverters have a direct impact on the cost and expected return on investment of solar installations to both installers and system owners:
•Installer. Solar PV installers aim for simple installation design, fast installation times and maximum system performance and predictability. The installation of high-voltage DC central inverter technology, however, requires significant preparation, precautionary safety measures, time-consuming string calculations, extensive design expertise and specialized installation equipment, training and knowledge. Together, these factors significantly increase complexity and cost of installation and limit overall productivity for the installer.
•System owner. Solar power system owners aim for high energy production, low cost, high reliability, and low maintenance requirements, as well as reduced fire risks. With traditional central inverters, owners often are unable to optimize the size or shape of their solar PV installations due to string design limitations. As such, they experience performance loss from shading and other obstructions, can face frequent system failures and lack the ability to effectively monitor the performance of their solar PV installation. In addition, central inverter installations operate at high-voltage DC which bears significant fire risks. Further, due to their large size, central inverter installations can affect architectural aesthetics of the house or commercial building.
The solar industry is transitioning from solar only systems to complete energy management solutions, which consist of solar-plus storage and load control.
Our Products
We design, develop, manufacture and sell home energy solutions that manage energy generation, energy storage and control and communications on one intelligent platform. We have revolutionized the solar industry by bringing a systems approach to solar technology and by pioneering a semiconductor-based microinverter that converts energy at the individual solar module level and, combined with our proprietary networking and software technologies, provides advanced energy monitoring and control. This is vastly different than a central inverter system using string modules, with or without an optimizer, approach that only converts energy of the entire array of solar modules from a single high voltage electrical unit and lacks intelligence about the energy producing capacity of the solar array. The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ™ platform, which is our current generation integrated solar, storage and energy management offering, enables self-consumption and delivers our core value proposition of yielding more energy, simplifying design and installation, and improving system uptime and reliability. The IQ family of microinverters, like all of our previous microinverters, is fully compliant with NEC 2014 and 2017 rapid shutdown requirements. Unlike string inverters, this capability is built-in, with no additional equipment necessary.
The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ™ brings a high technology, networked approach to solar generation plus energy storage, by leveraging our design expertise across power electronics, semiconductors and cloud-based software technologies. Our integrated approach to energy solutions maximizes a home’s energy potential while providing advanced monitoring and remote maintenance capabilities. The Enphase Home Energy Solution with IQ uses a single technology platform for seamless management of the whole solution, enabling rapid commissioning with the Installer Toolkit™; consumption monitoring with our Envoy™ Communications Gateway with IQ Combiner+, Enphase Enlighten, a cloud-based energy management platform, and our Enphase AC Battery™. System owners can use Enphase Enlighten to monitor their home’s solar generation, energy storage and consumption from any web-enabled device. Unlike some of our competitors, who utilize a traditional inverter, or offer separate components of solutions, we have built-in system redundancy in both PV generation and energy storage, eliminating the risk that comes with a single-point of failure. Further, the nature of our cloud-based, monitored system allows for remote firmware and software updates, enabling cost-effective remote maintenance and ongoing utility compliance.
The Enphase IQ 7™ microinverter and Enphase IQ 7+™ microinverter, part of our seventh-generation IQ product family, support high-powered 60-cell and 72-cell solar modules and integrate with alternating current (“AC”) modules. Our IQ 7X™ microinverter addresses 96-cell photovoltaic (“PV”) modules up to 400W direct DC and with its 97.5% California Energy Commission (“CEC”) efficiency rating, is ideal for integration into high power modules.

During 2020, we started shipping our IQ 7A™ for high-power monofacial and bifacial solar modules to customers in Australia and Europe. Our IQ 7A microinverters, which began shipping to customers in North America in November 2019, support up to 450W high-power modules, targeting high-power residential and commercial applications. Our customers will be able to pair the IQ 7A microinverter with monofacial or bifacial solar modules, up to 450 W, from solar module manufacturers who are expected to introduce high-power variants of their products in the next three years.
AC Module (“ACM”) products are integrated systems which allow installers to be more competitive through improved logistics, reduced installation times, faster inspection and training. We continued to make steady progress during the fourth quarter of 2020 with our ACM partners, including SunPower Corporation, Panasonic Corporation of North America, LONGi Solar, Solaria Corporation, Hanwha Q CELLS, and Maxeon Solar Technologies, Sonnenstromfabrik (CS Wismar GmBH), and DMEGC Solar.
During 2020, we introduced to customers in North America our Enphase storage system, featuring our Ensemble™ management technology, which powers the world’s first grid-independent microinverter-based storage system. Our next-generation battery in North America is Enphase Encharge 10™ or Encharge 3™ storage systems, with usable and scalable capacity of 10.1 kWh and 3.4 kWh, respectively. Enphase Encharge™ storage systems feature Enphase embedded grid-forming microinverters that enable the Always-On capability that keeps homes powered when the grid goes down, and the ability to save money when the grid is up. These systems are compatible with both new and existing Enphase IQ solar systems with IQ 6™, IQ 7™, M215 and M250 microinverters and provide a simple upgrade path for our existing solar customers. We started production shipments of Enphase Encharge storage systems to customers in North America during the second quarter of 2020.
We expect further revisions of our storage products with Ensemble technology to be released in 2021, with a focus on the grid-agnostic IQ 8 PV microinverter for residential installations. Our next-generation IQ 8™ system is based upon our Always On Enphase Ensemble™ energy management technology. This system has five components: 1) energy generation, which is accomplished with the grid-agnostic microinverter IQ 8; 2) energy storage, which is achieved by the Encharge™ battery with capacities of 10.1 kWh and 3.4 kWh; 3) Enpower™ smart switch, which includes a microgrid interconnect device (“MID”); 4) communication and control via the combiner box with the Envoy gateway; and 5) Enlighten, which is the internet of things (“IoT”), cloud software.
The advantage of IQ 8s on the roof will be that these grid-forming microinverters produce power from panels even during blackouts, as long as the sun is still shining. It addresses a major drawback of traditional solar installations without the need for storage and is differentiated in that respect.
We also expect to introduce both Enphase IQ 8D™ for commercial solar purposes and Ensemble-in-a Box, an off-grid solar and storage system.

Customers and Sales
We currently offer solutions targeting the residential and commercial markets in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Central American markets, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, India and certain other Asian markets. We sell our solutions primarily to solar distributors who resell to installers and integrators, who in turn integrate our products into complete solar PV installations for residential and commercial system owners. We work with many of the leading solar and electrical distributors. In addition to our distributors, we sell directly to large installers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), strategic partners and homeowners. Our OEM customers include solar module manufacturers who bundle our products and solutions with their solar module products and resell to both distributors and installers. We also sell certain products and services directly to the homeowners and the do-it-yourself market through our legacy product upgrade program or our online store. Strategic partners include a variety of companies including industrial equipment suppliers and providers of solar financing solutions. In 2020, one customer accounted for approximately 29% of total net revenues. The revenues generated from the U.S. market have represented 82%, 84% and 69% of our total revenue for annual period ending on December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Manufacturing, Quality Control and Key Suppliers
We outsource the manufacturing of our products to manufacturing partners. Flex Ltd. and affiliates (“Flex”) and Salcomp Manufacturing India Pvt. Ltd. (“Salcomp”) assemble and test our microinverter, AC Battery storage systems and Envoy products. Prices for such services are agreed to by the parties on a quarterly basis, and we are obligated to purchase manufactured products and raw materials that cannot be resold upon the termination of the agreement. Flex also provides receiving, kitting, storage, transportation, inventory visibility and other value-added logistics services at locations managed by Flex. Hong Kong Sinbon Industrial Limited manufactures our custom AC cables. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we qualified Amperex Technology Limited (“ATL”) in addition to A123 Systems LLC (“A123”) as our lithium-ion batteries suppliers to help increase our available capacity. In addition, we rely on several unaffiliated companies to supply certain components used in the fabrication of our products.
Our partnership with Flex and Salcomp provides us with strategic manufacturing capabilities and flexibility. In the beginning of the second quarter of 2019, we announced the first shipment of seventh-generation Enphase IQTM microinverters produced in Mexico as part of our expanded manufacturing agreement with Flex. In addition, we began microinverter production at Salcomp in India and started shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of 2020. We anticipate that this additional manufacturing capacity in Mexico and India could help us to not only mitigate tariffs, but also better serve our customers by cutting down delivery times and diversifying our supply chain.

Research and Development
We devote substantial resources to research and development with the objective of developing new products and systems, adding new features to existing products and systems and reducing unit costs. Our research and development roadmap identifies new system-level features and defines improvement targets for product cost and performance to support our growth and to optimize the effectiveness of our energy management solutions for our customers. We measure the effectiveness of our research and development against metrics that include product cost, efficiency, reliability and power output, as well as feature content and ease-of-use.
Intellectual Property
We operate in an industry in which innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property (“IP”), rights are critical for success. We protect our technology through a variety of means, including through patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. As of December 31, 2020, we had 234 issued U.S. patents, 80 issued foreign patents, 60 pending U.S. patent applications and 33 pending foreign counterpart patent applications. Our issued patents are scheduled to expire between years 2021 and 2040.
We license certain power line communications technology and software for integration into our custom application specific integrated circuits (“ASIC”s), under a fully-paid, royalty-free license, which includes the right for us to source directly from the licensor’s suppliers or manufacture certain ASIC hardware should the licensor fail, under certain conditions, to deliver such technology in the future. This license includes a limited exclusivity period during which the licensor has agreed not to license the licensed technology to any third-party manufacturer of electronic components or systems for use in the solar energy market. The license carries a 75-year term, subject to earlier termination upon agreement of the parties, or by us in connection with the insolvency of the licensor.
We also license digital intellectual property cores, or IP blocks, for integration into and distribution with certain electronic components built into our products, including our ASICs, complex programmable logic devices (“CPLDs”), and field-programmable gate arrays or FPGAs. This is a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license providing for the integration of such digital IP blocks in an unlimited number of electronic component designs and the distribution of such electronic components with our products. Other than in connection with the distribution of our products, our use of such digital IP blocks is limited to certain of our business sites. The license is perpetual, subject to earlier termination by either party upon the termination, suspension or insolvency of the other party’s business, or by the licensor upon a breach of the license agreement by us. In addition, we license open source software from third parties for integration into our Envoy products. Such open source software is licensed under open source licenses. These licenses are perpetual and require us to attribute the source of the software to the original software developer, which we provide via our website.
We continually assess the need for patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages. A majority of our patents relate to DC to AC power conversion and energy storage for alternative energy power systems, as well as power system monitoring, control and management systems.
With respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests. We believe that many elements of our microinverter and storage manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms and procedures.
We own or have rights to various registered trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries, including Enphase, Ensemble, Encharge Envoy, Enpower and Enlighten, and rely on both registration of our marks as well as common law protection where available.
All of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us. These agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us.
We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.

As part of our overall strategy to protect our intellectual property, we may take legal actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access to our technology.
Seasonality
Historically, the majority of our revenues are from the North American and European regions which experience higher sales of our products in the second, third and fourth quarters and have been affected by seasonal customer demand trends, including weather patterns and construction cycles. The first quarter historically has had softer customer demand in our industry, due to these same factors. Although these seasonal factors are common in the solar sector, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.
Government Regulations
Our business activities are global and are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules and regulations. For example, substantially all of our import operations are subject to complex trade and customs laws, regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs set by governments through mutual agreements or unilateral actions. In addition, the countries in which our products are manufactured or imported may from time to time impose additional duties, tariffs or other restrictions on our imports or adversely modify existing restrictions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, the disallowance of tax deductions on imported merchandise, or the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures and results of operations.
Privacy and Security Laws
There are also data privacy and security laws to which we are currently, and/or may in the future, be subject. The U.S., federal government, individual U.S. states, EU member countries and other jurisdictions, including Switzerland, have adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. Moreover, the collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the control over personal data by individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the documentation we must maintain, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and authorizes the imposition of large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for significant fines. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between us and our subsidiaries, including employee information. The GDPR has increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to all types of personal data that we process, including in clinical trials, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the GDPR, which could divert management’s attention and increase our cost of doing business. However, despite our ongoing efforts to bring our practices into compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful either due to various factors within our control or other factors outside our control. It is also possible that local data protection authorities may have different interpretations of the GDPR, leading to potential inconsistencies amongst various EU member states.

Additionally, in June 2018, the state of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which contains requirements similar to GDPR for the handling of personal information of California residents, which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. It remains unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data. As we expand our operations, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Additionally, other states are beginning to pass similar laws.
Government Incentives
U.S. federal, state, and local government bodies, as well as non-U.S. government bodies provide incentives to owners, distributors, system integrators and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar energy in the form of rebates, tax credits, lower VAT rate and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation and exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. The market for on‑grid applications, where solar power is used to supplement a customer’s electricity purchased from the utility network or sold to a utility under tariff, often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives, which vary by geographic market and from time to time, thus helping to catalyze customer acceptance of solar energy as an alternative to utility-provided power.
Our revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first quarter of 2020 was positively impacted by the scheduled phase-down of the investment tax credit for solar projects under Section 48(a) (the “ITC”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act of 2008 provided a 30% federal tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through December 31, 2019, which was reduced to a tax credit of 26% for any solar energy system that began construction during 2020 through December 31, 2022, and 22% thereafter to December 31, 2023 before being reduced to 10% for commercial installations and 0% for residential installations beginning on January 1, 2024. As a result, several of our customers explored opportunities to purchase products in 2019 to take advantage of safe harbor guidance from the IRS published in June 2018, allowing them to preserve the historical 30% investment tax credit for solar equipment purchased in 2019 for solar projects that are completed after December 31, 2019.

The Company 


        Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a holding company originally incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in July 2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc" and became a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.


Bemis Company, Inc. Merger


        On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the "Agreement") between Amcor Limited and Bemis dated August 6, 2018. Under the terms of the Agreement, Bemis shareholders received 5.1 Amcor shares for each share of Bemis stock and Amcor shareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument ("CDI") for each share of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction, the Amcor shares were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "AMCR" and the CDI's representing our shares on the Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") are traded under the symbol "AMC." In addition, Amcor Limited shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares were delisted from the NYSE.
        
Business Strategy


Strategy


        Our strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment.


Focused portfolio


        Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics:


•A focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,
•good industry structure,
•attractive relative growth, and
•multiple paths for us to win from our leadership position, scale and other competitive advantages.


        These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.


Differentiated capabilities


        "The Amcor Way" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership, Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline.


Shareholder value creation


        Through our portfolio of focused business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value. The defensive nature of our end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time value creation has been strong and consistent through paying dividends and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets and pursuing targeted acquisitions or by returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks.

Segment Information


        Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, the Company has determined it has two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reporting segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to Note 20, "Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reporting segments.


Flexibles Segment


        The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 40,000 employees at 181 principal manufacturing facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2020, the Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2020, Flexibles accounted for approximately 78% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.


Rigid Packaging Segment


        The Rigid Packaging Segment manufacturers rigid packaging containers and related products in the Americas. As of June 30, 2020, the Rigid Packaging Segment employed approximately 6,000 employees at 50 principal manufacturing facilities in 11 countries. In fiscal year 2020, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 22% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.


Marketing, Distribution, and Competition


        Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization. 


        We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020. Sales to PepsiCo, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11.1% and 11.0% of our sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Business arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time.


         The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors include AptarGroup, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global Group, Inc, CCL Industries Inc., Crown Holdings, Inc., Graphic Packaging Holding Company, Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, O-I Glass, Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings Inc., Sonoco Products Company and WestRock Company, and a variety of privately held companies. 


        We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we serve; however, due to the diversity of our business, our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. 


Backlog


        Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate.


Raw Materials


        Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions. Currently, raw materials are readily available but pricing may fluctuate.

Intellectual Property


        We are the owner or licensee of a number of United States and other country patents and patent applications that relate to our products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our reporting segments. Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise.


Sustainability, Innovation and Environmental Laws and Regulations


        We believe there will always be a role for the primary packages made by Amcor. Packaging protects and preserves food and healthcare products, and reduces the carbon footprint and waste of products. It extends shelf life and reduces food
and other product loss across a range of distribution channels. Consumers want cost effective, convenient and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution to reduce waste. We believe responsible packaging is the answer to achieve less waste through innovative packaging design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation.


        Amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success. In January 2018, we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world.


        We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents. We collaborate with customers, suppliers, and innovators to create industry-leading solutions, and with stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection, sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the environmental implications of their packaging. We are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging. Addressing the need for and increasing the supply of responsible packaging is one of the most important growth opportunities for Amcor.


        Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections of the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits of those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future, incur liability, with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 19, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors".


Employees


        As of June 30, 2020, we employed approximately 47,000 people worldwide, with approximately 42% of those employees being covered by collective bargaining agreements. Our relations with employees under collective bargaining agreements remain satisfactory and there have been no significant work stoppages or other labor disputes during the past three years. For more on collective bargaining and labor disputes, see "Item 1A - Risk Factors."


Seasonal Factors 


        The business of each of the reporting segments is not seasonal to any material extent.


Research and Development


        Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our research and development expenditures and policies.

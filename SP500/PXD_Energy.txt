Mission and Strategies
The Company's mission is to be America's leading independent energy company, focused on value, safety, the environment, technology and its people. The Company's long-term strategy is centered around the following strategic objectives:
•maintaining a strong balance sheet to ensure financial flexibility;
•delivering economic production and proved reserve additions through drilling, completion and production improvement activities;
•utilizing the Company's scale and technology advancements to reduce costs and improve efficiency;
•reinvesting 50 percent to 60 percent of Company's operating cash flow, with the remaining cash flow targeted to debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders, primarily through dividends;
•evaluating accretive acquisitions or acreage trades that enhance the Company's reinvestment framework and allow incremental cash flow to be returned to shareholders;
•developing and training employees and contractors to perform their jobs in a safe manner; and
•stewarding the environment through industry leading sustainable development efforts.
The Company's long-term strategy is anchored by the Company's interests in the long-lived Spraberry/Wolfcamp oil field located in the Permian Basin in West Texas, which has an estimated remaining productive life in excess of 45 years.
Competition
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, marketing of oil, NGL and gas production, the obtaining of equipment and services and the hiring and retention of staff necessary for the identification, evaluation, operation and acquisition and development of oil and gas properties. The Company's competitors include a large number of companies, including major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and individuals engaged in the exploration for and development of oil and gas properties. The Company also faces competition from companies that supply alternative sources of energy, such as wind, solar power, and other renewables. Competition will increase as alternative energy technology becomes more reliable and governments throughout the world support or mandate the use of such alternative energy.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
A novel strain of the coronavirus ("COVID-19") surfaced in late 2019 and has spread around the world, including to the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and created significant volatility in the financial markets. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions, business closures and other restrictions that have disrupted the demand for oil throughout the world and when combined with pressures on the global supply-demand balance for oil and related products, resulted in significant volatility in oil prices beginning in late February 2020. The length of this demand disruption is unknown, and will ultimately depend on various factors beyond the Company's control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic, the length and severity of the worldwide economic downturn, the ability of OPEC, Russia and other oil producing nations to manage the global oil supply, additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic, the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines, and the time necessary to balance oil supply and demand. Additionally, there is significant uncertainty regarding the lasting impacts of the pandemic on global demand, as it cannot be predicted as to whether certain demand-reducing behaviors such as declines in business travel and changes in work-from-home practices will persist beyond the resolution of the pandemic. In response to these developments the Company has implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its employees, operations and financial position. These measures include, but are not limited to, the following:
Employee Health and Safety. The Company has taken steps to keep its employees safe in light of the COVID-19 pandemic by implementing preventative measures and developing response plans intended to minimize unnecessary risk of exposure and infection among its employees, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the "CDC"). The Company has also modified certain business practices (including those related to non-operational employee work locations, such as a significant reduction in business travel and physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by the CDC, and other governmental and regulatory authorities.
Expense Management. With the reduction in revenue associated with lower oil prices during 2020, the Company focused its efforts on:
•Optimizing drilling, completion and operational efficiencies, resulting in lower well costs and operating costs and
•Reducing general and administrative and other overhead related costs through:
◦a corporate restructuring to reduce the Company's staffing levels to correspond with a planned reduction in future activity levels, resulting in approximately 300 employees being involuntarily separated from the Company in October 2020 (the "2020 Corporate Restructuring");
◦voluntary salary reductions by the Company's officers and board of directors from March 2020 through December 2020;
◦reductions in 2020 cash incentive compensation;
◦2020 benefit reductions; and
◦other cash cost reductions.
Balance Sheet, Cash Flow and Liquidity. During 2020, the Company also took the following actions to strengthen its financial position and increase liquidity during the COVID-19 pandemic:
•Reduced its 2020 capital budget by over 50 percent,
•Enhanced its liquidity position by refinancing a portion of its existing debt and issuing new debt, with the combined objective of increasing liquidity, extending the Company's debt maturities and lowering the Company's future cash interest expense on long-term debt, and
•Adjusted the Company's derivative positions to reduce the effects of oil price volatility on its net cash provided by operating activities.
The Company continues to assess the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and may modify its plans as the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 continue to evolve.

Acquisition Activities
The Company regularly seeks to acquire or trade acreage that complements its operations, provides exploration and development opportunities, increases the lateral length of future horizontal wells and provides superior returns on investment (including opportunities to acquire particular oil and gas assets or entities owning oil and gas assets and opportunities to engage in mergers, consolidations or other business combinations with such entities). The Company periodically evaluates and pursues acquisition and acreage trade opportunities and at any given time may be in various stages of evaluating such opportunities. Such stages may take the form of internal financial analyses, oil and gas reserve analyses, due diligence, the submission of indications of interest, preliminary negotiations, negotiations of letters of intent or negotiations of definitive agreements. The success of any acquisition or acreage trade is uncertain and depends on a number of factors, some of which are outside the Company's control.
On January 12, 2021, the Company acquired Parsley Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation that previously traded on the NYSE under the symbol "PE" ("Parsley"), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 20, 2020, among Pioneer, certain of its subsidiaries, Parsley and Parsley's subsidiary, Parsley Energy, LLC (the "Parsley Acquisition"). Although this Annual Report is being filed following the completion of the Parsley Acquisition, unless otherwise specifically noted, information set forth herein only relates to the period as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 and therefore does not include information relating to Parsley or its subsidiaries as of and for such periods. Accordingly, unless otherwise specifically noted, references herein to "Pioneer" or the "Company" refer only to Pioneer and its subsidiaries prior to the Parsley Acquisition and do not include Parsley or its subsidiaries.
The Parsley Acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination, with the fair value of consideration allocated to the acquisition date fair value of assets and liabilities acquired. Parsley's post-acquisition date results of operations will be consolidated into the Company's interim consolidated financial statements beginning on January 12, 2021. See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Marketing of Production
General. Production from the Company's properties is marketed using methods that are consistent with industry practices. Sales prices for oil, NGL and gas production are negotiated based on factors normally considered in the industry, such as an index or spot price, distance from the well to a major pipeline, commodity quality and prevailing supply and demand conditions. See "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" for additional information.
Seasonal nature of business. Generally, but not always, the demand for gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers may impact general seasonal changes in demand.
Delivery commitments. The Company has committed certain volumes of oil, NGL and gas to customers under a variety of contracts, some of which have volumetric firm transportation or fractionation requirements that could require monetary shortfall penalties if the Company's transported or fractionation volumes are insufficient to satisfy associated commitments. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" for additional information.
Significant purchasers. During 2020 the Company's oil, NGL and gas sales to Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P., Occidental Energy Marketing Inc. and Plains Marketing L.P accounted for 36 percent, 18 percent and 14 percent of the Company's oil and gas revenues, respectively. The loss of one of these significant purchasers or an inability to secure adequate pipeline, gas plant and NGL fractionation infrastructure for its Permian Basin production could have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to produce and sell its oil, NGL and gas production.
Revenues from sales of purchased oil and gas to Occidental Energy Marketing Inc. accounted for 28 percent of the Company's sales of purchased oil and gas. No other sales customer exceeded ten percent of the Company's sales of purchased oil and gas during 2020. The loss of the Company's significant purchaser of purchased oil and gas would not be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's ability to sell commodities it purchases from third parties.

Human Capital
At December 31, 2020, the Company had 1,853 employees, 698 of whom were employed in field operations and 256 of whom were employed in vertical integration activities. The Company understands that employee recruiting, retention and development play a critical role to the Company's business activities and its ability to achieve its long-term strategy. The Company offers a competitive compensation and benefits program and has established policies and talent development programs with the goal of creating an inclusive environment to allow all employees to feel respected, valued and connected to the business.
Compensation and benefits program. The Company annually reviews compensation for all employees to adjust compensation for market conditions and attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. The Company considers its employees to be its greatest asset and encourages them to take full advantage of the benefits and programs the Company offers. To ensure Pioneer attracts and retains top talent, the Company maintains an above-average benefits package. Pioneer's employees participate in incentive plans that take into consideration individual and Company performance through a traditional bonus plan that is influenced by individual performance and a variable compensation plan denominated in Company stock. In addition to cash and equity compensation, the Company also offers other employee benefits such as life and health (medical, dental & vision) insurance, paid time off, paid parental leave, flexible work schedules and a 401(k) plan.
Diversity and inclusion. The Company is committed to creating an inclusive environment where all employees feel respected, valued and connected to the business — a workplace to which individuals bring their "authentic" selves and can be successful in achieving their goals. The Company has established a variety of diversity and inclusion initiatives, such as OnePioneer, a single organization that was created in 2019 through the merger of Pioneer's various employee resource groups. OnePioneer is led by a diverse representation of the Company's employees who advance diversity and inclusion across the entire company.
Talent development. The Company's talent planning approach identifies and targets development for critical talent. The Company identifies critical roles based on several factors, including strategic importance, scope and impact, and unique skills. Successor candidates for those critical roles are then identified as those who have the interest, ability and experience to succeed in the critical role within five years. Talent planning enables Pioneer to proactively approach succession planning and offer targeted development for high potential employees and successors, while enabling a cross-functional view of talent to increase visibility and mobility.
Community involvement. Pioneer's dedication to community well-being and success shows in the many ways the Company seeks to be a good neighbor in all of its operating areas. The Company's employees continually seek out events, organizations, initiatives and partnerships to support, and the Company is honored to support their ongoing efforts to enrich the communities where they live and work, including through a charitable matching program.
Health, safety and environment. The Company maintains a culture of continuous improvement in safety and environmental practices, supports a diverse workforce and inspires teamwork to drive innovation, with oversight from the Health, Safety and Environment Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the board of directors.
Regulation
The oil and gas industry is extensively regulated at the federal, state, and local levels. Regulations affecting elements of the energy sector are under constant review for amendment or expansion over time and frequently more stringent requirements are imposed. Various federal and state agencies, including the Texas Railroad Commission, the Bureau of Land Management (the "BLM"), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA"), have legal and regulatory authority and oversight over the Company's exploration and development activities and operations. Other agencies with certain authority over the Company's business include the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), the SEC and NYSE. Ensuring compliance with the rules, regulations and orders promulgated by such entities requires extensive effort and incremental costs to comply, which consequently affects the Company's profitability. Because public policy changes are commonplace, and existing laws and regulations are frequently amended, the Company is unable to predict the future cost or impact of compliance. However, the Company does not expect that any of these laws and regulations will affect its operations materially differently than they would affect other companies with similar operations, size and financial strength.
The following are significant areas of government control and regulation affecting the Company:
Securities regulations. Enterprises that sell securities in public markets are subject to regulatory oversight by agencies such as the SEC and the NYSE. This regulatory oversight imposes on the Company many requirements, including the

Table of Contents
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
responsibility for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures alongside internal controls over financial reporting, and ensuring that the financial statements and other information included in submissions to the SEC do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made in such submissions not misleading. Failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC could subject the Company to litigation from public or private plaintiffs. Failure to comply with the rules of the NYSE could result in the delisting of the Company's common stock, which would have an adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the Company's common stock. Compliance with some of these rules and regulations is costly, and regulations are subject to change or reinterpretation.
Environmental and occupational health and safety matters. The Company strives to conduct its operations in a socially and environmentally responsible manner and is required to comply with many federal, state and local laws, regulations and executive orders concerning occupational safety and health, the discharge or other release of materials and protection of the environment and natural resources. These environmental legal requirements primarily relate to:
•the discharge or other release of pollutants into federal and state waters;
•assessing the environmental impact of seismic acquisition, drilling or construction activities;
•the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials, including hazardous substances;
•the emission of certain gases, including GHGs, into the atmosphere;
•the monitoring, abandonment, reclamation and remediation of well and other sites, including sites of former operations;
•the development of emergency response and spill contingency plans;
•the protection of threatened and endangered species; and
•worker protection.

The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time:
•the Clean Air Act ("CAA"), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre construction, operational, monitoring and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to GHG emissions;
•the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act ("CWA"), which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
•the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
•the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport and disposal of solid wastes, including oil and gas exploration and production wastes and hazardous wastes;
•the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), which ensures the quality of the nation's public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;
•OSHA, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures; and
•the Endangered Species Act ("ESA"), which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats through the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal or permanent ban in affected areas.
Additionally, there exist tribal, state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. Failure by the Company to comply with these laws, regulations and regulatory initiatives or controls may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; and issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Historically, the Company's environmental and worker safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on its results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operational results.
The Company owns, leases or operates numerous properties that have been used for oil and gas exploration and production activities for many years. The Company also has acquired certain properties from third parties whose actions with

10
Table of Contents
PIONEER NATURAL RESOURCES COMPANY
respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes at or from such properties were not under the Company's control prior to acquiring them. Under certain environmental laws and regulations such as CERCLA and RCRA, the Company could incur strict joint and several liability due to damages to natural resources or for remediating hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators. Moreover, an accidental release of materials into the environment during the Company's operations may cause it to incur significant costs and liabilities. The Company also could incur costs related to the clean-up of third-party sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at or from such third-party sites.

Over time, the trend in environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations is to typically place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may adversely affect the environment or expose workers to injury. If existing legal requirements change or new legislative, regulatory or executive initiatives are developed and implemented in the future, the Company may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. The Company may not have insurance or be fully covered by insurance against all environmental and occupational health and safety risks. For more information on environmental and occupational health and safety matters, see the risk factors identified as Health, Safety and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Other regulation of the oil and gas industry. The Company's oil and gas operations are subject to laws and regulations that relate to matters including:
•the acquisition of seismic data;
•location, drilling and casing of wells;
•hydraulic fracturing;
•well production operations;
•disposal of produced water;
•regulation of transportation and sale of oil, NGLs and gas;
•surface usage;
•calculation and disbursement of royalty payments and production taxes;
•restoration of properties used for oil and gas operations; and
•transportation of production.
Development and production operations are subject to regulations including requiring permits for the drilling of wells, the posting of bonds in connection with various types of activities and filing reports concerning operations. Texas, and some municipalities in which the Company operates, also regulate one or more of the following:
•the location of wells;
•the method of drilling and casing wells;
•the method and ability to fracture stimulate wells;
•the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
•the plugging and abandoning of wells; and
•notice to surface owners and other third parties.
State laws regulate the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the drilling and production of oil and gas properties. The Company relies on voluntary pooling, production sharing agreements and the drilling of allocation wells to develop its leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce the Company's interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells and generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas without a permit. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and gas the Company can produce from the Company's wells, negatively affect the economic decision to continue to produce these wells or limit the number of wells or locations that the Company can economically drill.
Approximately one percent of the Company's U.S. oil and gas leases are granted or approved by the federal government and administered by the BLM. All of the Company's federal leases are outside of Texas and the Company has no current plans to further develop the leases at this time. Such leases require compliance with detailed federal regulations and orders that regulate, among other matters, drilling and operations on lands covered by these leases and calculation and disbursement of royalty payments to the federal government.
See the risk factors identified as Regulatory Risks and Health, Safety and Environmental Risks in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

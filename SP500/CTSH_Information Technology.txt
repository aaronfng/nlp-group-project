Overview

Cognizant is one of the world’s leading professional services companies, engineering modern business for the digital era. Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services. Digital services have become an increasingly important part of our portfolio, aligning with our clients' focus on becoming data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. We are focused on continued investment in four key areas of digital: IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud. We tailor our services and solutions to specific industries with an integrated global delivery model that employs client service and delivery teams based at client locations and dedicated global and regional delivery centers.
During 2020, we announced the Cognizant Agenda which articulates our purpose, vision and values.
ctsh-20201231_g1.jpg
In order to achieve this vision and support our clients, we are focusing our business on four strategic priorities to increase our commercial momentum and accelerate growth. These strategic priorities include:
•Accelerating digital - growing our digital business organically and inorganically;
•Globalizing Cognizant - growing our business in key international markets and diversifying leadership, capabilities and delivery footprint;
•Repositioning our brand - improving global brand recognition and becoming better known as a global digital partner to the entire C-suite; and
•Increasing our relevance to our clients - leading with thought leadership and capabilities to address clients' business needs.
We seek to drive organic growth through investments in our digital capabilities across industries and geographies, including the extensive training and reskilling of our technical teams and the expansion of our local workforces in the United States and other markets around the world. Additionally, we pursue select strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances that can expand our talent, experience and capabilities in key digital areas or in particular geographies or industries. In 2020, we completed nine such acquisitions. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Certain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the Glossary included at the end of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Business Segments
We go to market across our four industry-based business segments. Our clients seek to partner with service providers that have a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives, customers, markets and cultures and the ability to create solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. Across industries, our clients are confronted with the risk of being disrupted by nimble, digital-native competitors. They are therefore redirecting their focus and investment to digital operating models and embracing DevOps and key technologies that enable quick adjustments to shifts in their markets. We believe that our deep knowledge of the industries we serve and our clients’ businesses has been central to our growth and high client satisfaction, and we continue to invest in those digital capabilities that help to enable our clients to become modern businesses.

Our business segments are as follows:
																				
Financial Services		Healthcare		Products and Resources		Communications, Media and Technology
• Banking
• Insurance
		
• Healthcare
• Life Sciences
		
• Retail and Consumer Goods
• Manufacturing, Logistics, Energy and Utilities
• Travel and Hospitality
		
• Communications and Media
• Technology
Our Financial Services segment includes banking, capital markets and insurance companies. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ business needs for serving their customers while being compliant with significant regulatory requirements and adaptable to regulatory change, as well as our clients' adoption and integration of digital technologies, including customer experience enhancement, robotic process automation, analytics and AI in areas such as digital lending, fraud detection and next generation payments. In addition to platforms that drive outcomes at speed, demand is also created by our clients’ desire for less complexity through packaged solutions and suppliers with embedded product partners.
Our Healthcare segment consists of healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies. Demand in this segment is driven by emerging industry trends, including enhanced compliance, integrated health management, claims investigative services and heightened focus on patient experience, as well as services that drive operational improvements in areas such as claims processing, enrollment, membership and billing. Demand is also created by the adoption and integration of digital technologies such as AI to shape personalized care plans and predictive data analytics to improve patient outcomes.
Our Products and Resources segment includes manufacturers, retailers and travel and hospitality companies, as well as companies providing logistics, energy and utility services. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ focus on improving the efficiency of their operations, the enablement and integration of mobile platforms to support sales and other omni-channel commerce initiatives, and their adoption and integration of digital technologies, such as the application of intelligent systems to manage supply chains and enhance overall customer experiences, and IoT to instrument functions for factories, real estate, fleets and products to increase access to insight-generating data.
Our Communications, Media and Technology segment includes information, media and entertainment, communications and technology companies. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ needs to create differentiated user experiences, transition to agile development methodologies, enhance their networks, manage their digital content and adopt and integrate digital technologies, such as cloud, interactive and IoT. During 2020, we exited certain content-related work within this segment that was not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the Company. Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the distribution of our revenues across our four industry-based business segments was as follows:
ctsh-20201231_g2.jpg
The services we provide are distributed among a number of clients in each of our business segments. A loss of a significant client or a few significant clients in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment. The services we provide to our larger clients are often critical to their operations and a termination of our services would typically require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. Nevertheless, the volume of work performed for specific clients may vary significantly from year to year.
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to disaggregation of revenues by client location, service line and contract-type for each of our business segments.

Services and Solutions
Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application services, systems integration, infrastructure services and business process services. Additionally, we develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products and platforms. Central to our strategy to align with our clients’ need to modernize is our continued investment in four key areas of digital: IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud. These four capabilities enable clients to put data at the core of their operations, improve the experiences they offer to their customers, tap into new revenue streams, defend against technology-enabled competitors and reduce costs. In many cases, our clients' new digital systems are built on the backbone of their existing legacy systems. The demand for digital capabilities has continued to increase since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of increased demand for mobile workplace solutions, e-commerce, automation and AI and cybersecurity services and solutions. We believe our deep knowledge of our clients' infrastructure and systems provides us with a significant advantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities to make their operations more efficient, effective and modern. We deliver all of our services and solutions across our four industry-based business segments to best address our clients' individual needs.
In 2020, our services and solutions were organized into three practice areas: Digital Business, Digital Systems and Technology and Digital Business Operations. In January 2021, we strategically combined the Digital Business practice with the Digital Systems and Technology practice to create the new Digital Business & Technology practice. The objective of this change is to simplify our model and align it with the current state of technology.

Our consulting professionals work closely with our practice areas to create modern frameworks, platforms and solutions that leverage a wide range of digital technologies across our clients’ businesses to deliver higher levels of efficiency and new value for their customers.
Digital Business & Technology
Our Digital Business & Technology practice helps clients build modern enterprises that deliver exceptional customer experiences that are created at the intersection of cloud and digital. Our clients are able to embrace a new business and technology stack that comprises consumer-grade software, enterprise applications, modernized data and the instrumentation of everything in cloud-first architectures. Combining a technology vision, strategy, roadmap, capabilities, solutions, partnerships, and subject matter expertise, Digital Business & Technology is an integrated growth enabler for commercial markets. Areas of focus within this practice area are:
•Interactive, which leverages our global network of studios that help clients craft new experiences;
•application modernization, which updates legacy applications using agile methodologies and cloud;
•AI and analytics, which drive business growth and efficiencies through a greater understanding of customers and operations;
•IoT, which unlocks greater productivity and new business models;
•digital advisory, which provides enterprise transformation expertise;
•experience-driven software engineering, which designs, engineers and delivers modern business software;
•application services;
•quality engineering and assurance; and
•cloud, infrastructure and security.
Digital Business Operations
Our Digital Business Operations practice helps clients rethink their operating models by assessing their existing processes and recommending automation. This allows clients to fundamentally transform their processes while realizing cost savings benefits from these improvements. Areas of focus within this practice area are:
•automation, analytics and consulting for business process outsourcing;
•platform-based operations; and
•core business process operations.
We have extensive knowledge of core front office, middle office and back office processes, including finance and accounting, research and analytics, procurement and data management, which we integrate with our industry and technology expertise to deliver targeted business process services and solutions.

Global Delivery Model
We utilize a global delivery model, with delivery centers worldwide to provide our full range of services to our clients. Our delivery model includes employees deployed at client sites, local or in-country delivery centers, regional delivery centers and offshore delivery centers, as required to best serve our clients. As we scale our digital services and solutions, we are focused on hiring in the United States and other countries where we deliver services to our clients to expand our in-country delivery capabilities. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure are designed to enable the effective collaboration of our global workforce across locations and geographies.
Competition
The markets for our services are highly competitive, characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change. Competitors may include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies, cloud computing service providers, traditional consulting firms, professional services groups of computer equipment companies, infrastructure management companies, outsourcing companies and boutique digital companies. Our direct competitors include, among others, Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, EPAM Systems, Genpact, HCL Technologies, IBM Global Services, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. In addition, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.
The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our services include the provider’s reputation and experience, strategic advisory capabilities, digital services capabilities, performance and reliability, responsiveness to customer needs, financial stability, corporate governance and competitive pricing of services. Accordingly, we rely on the following to compete effectively:
•investments to scale our digital services;
•our recruiting, training and retention model;
•our global delivery model;
•an entrepreneurial culture and approach to our work;
•a broad client referral base;
•investment in process improvement and knowledge capture;
•financial stability and good corporate governance;
•continued focus on responsiveness to client needs, quality of services and competitive prices; and
•project management capabilities and technical expertise.
Intellectual Property
We provide value to our clients based, in part, on our proprietary innovations, methodologies, software, reusable knowledge capital and other IP assets. We recognize the importance of IP and its ability to differentiate us from our competitors. We seek IP protection for many of our innovations and rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our IP. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our brands, including our Cognizant brand, which is one of our most valuable assets. We own or are licensed under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights of varying duration, relating to our products and services. We also have policies requiring our associates to respect the IP rights of others. While our proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular IP right or any particular group of patents, trademarks, copyrights or licenses, other than our Cognizant brand.
Cognizant® and other trademarks appearing in this report are registered trademarks or trademarks of Cognizant and its affiliates in the United States and other countries, or third parties, as applicable.
Workforce
We had approximately 289,500 employees at the end of 2020, with 43,500 in North America, 13,400 in Continental Europe, 6,800 in the United Kingdom and 225,800 in various other locations throughout the rest of the world, including 204,500 in India. This represents a decrease of 3,000 employees as compared to December 31, 2019. We utilize subcontractors to provide additional capacity and flexibility in meeting client demand, though the number of subcontractors has historically been immaterial relative to our employee headcount. We are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements.

We balance the portion of our employees in the United States and other jurisdictions that rely on visas with consideration of the needs of our business to fulfill client demand and risks to our business from potential changes in immigration laws and regulations that may increase the costs associated with and ability to staff employees on visas to work in-country.
Engaging Our People
As a global professional services company, Cognizant competes on the basis of the knowledge, experience, insights, skills and talent of its employees and the value they can provide to our clients. We aim for our employees to feel motivated, engaged, and empowered to do their best work through careers they find meaningful. In a market where competition for skilled IT professionals is intense, we focus on the following:
•Advancing Diversity & Inclusion: We believe diversity and inclusion are at the heart of our ability to execute successfully and consistently over the long term. A diverse and inclusive workforce strengthens our ability to innovate and to understand our clients’ needs and aspirations.
Highlights from our diversity & inclusion efforts include:
–Our Global D&I organization is embedded within HR’s Talent & Transformation function to drive accountability through our people processes and systems;
–Global D&I training and programs;
–Progressive hiring policies, including a diverse candidate pipeline initiative to ensure a more diverse interview slate at the Vice President level and above; and
–Seven global affinity groups that welcome, nurture and provide safe spaces in which our employees can share their unique interests and aspirations.
Our 2020 engagement survey revealed that all genders are equally engaged, and that D&I gained the second-highest score improvement across categories.
•Rewarding and Recognizing High Performance: We aim to create a work environment where every person is inspired to achieve, driven to perform and rewarded for their contributions. We leverage regular, performance-based promotions and merit increases as one lever to engage high-performing talent. During the 2020 cycle, in line with our high performance culture, we were proud to promote employees across all levels and provide merit increases to a significant number of our employees.
We regularly monitor employee retention levels and continue to enhance our pay-for-performance approach to improve attrition rates. For the three months ended December 31, 2020, annualized attrition, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 19.0%. Attrition for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, including both voluntary and involuntary, was 20.6% and 21.7%, respectively. Voluntary attrition normally constitutes the significant majority of our attrition. In 2020, we saw elevated levels of involuntary attrition due to our Fit for Growth Plan, including the exit from certain content-related services. We also saw a decrease in voluntary attrition from historic levels in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both voluntary and involuntary attrition are weighted towards our more junior employees.
•Building New Skills: Clients count on us to know their industries, businesses, and technology environments, readily gain new digital skills and insights, and apply our knowledge to help them increase their competitiveness. We continually reskill and upskill our employees with a focus on building digital skills in areas such as IoT, AI, experience-driven software engineering and cloud.
From campus hire training for our entry-level workforce to providing capability assurance programs for professional practitioners, we offer a learning ecosystem for employees at all levels. This includes learning and development, access-from-anywhere learning platforms and a variety of content curation partnerships. Our talent development approach has been recognized by leading learning and development organizations, such as the Association for Talent Development, the Brandon Hall Group and the Learning and Performance Institute.
•Leadership Development & Talent Management: Cognizant continuously fosters and builds its pipeline of diverse, high-performing leaders who have the breadth and versatility to drive our growth. To do this, we focus on engaging all levels of senior talent and enabling their success through continuous assessment and high impact development opportunities.

Highlights include:
–Targeted talent programs for key pools that include various training opportunities, digital leadership programs and custom leadership development initiatives;
–Fast-tracking high-performing and high-potential leadership talent through personalized assessments, executive coaching and executive education programs;
–Accelerating a diverse leadership pipeline through programs like Propel, an initiative focused on priming the next level of women leaders within Cognizant. In just two years, this program has helped us reach 500 women leaders globally through a cohort model supported by executive sponsors, part of our pledge to put 1,000 women through our leadership development program;
–Our LEAD@Cognizant partnership with Harvard University is a 4.5-month leadership capability program designed exclusively for Cognizant leaders to learn, practice and internalize how to set the course, connect the dots, inspire followership and deliver results through strategic alignment, collaboration and building high performing teams; and
–Periodic talent processes such as talent reviews of our top 4,000 employees at Director level and above, aimed at helping individuals develop in role and prepare for the future, while strengthening our leadership pipeline overall.
•Supporting Well-Being at Work and Home: We offer benefits to care for the diverse needs of our associates and keep them feeling resilient, innovative and engaged. These include total compensation programs, health benefits, overall well-being and family care, tax savings programs, income protection and financial planning resources. As we continue to face evolving environmental and health challenges, we continually review and enhance our offerings to improve the competitiveness of our total compensation programs, including our health benefit offerings.
Highlights include:
–In 2020, we launched WorkFlex, a program to provide employees greater flexibility to complete their required hours outside their standard schedule or to transition to a part-time schedule to accommodate personal priorities;
–We offer a variety of benefits to support employee mental health, including a robust Employee Assistance Program. In the United States, we also provide access to third party mental health platforms, including Ginger and eMindful; and
–Cognizant has crisis management protocols that are mobilized to protect employee health and safety when necessary. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, our crisis team responded quickly to close and modify offices to meet health and safety protocols, support the transition to working from home, and liaise with employees regarding various concerns.
•Measuring and Enhancing Engagement: We regularly assess employee sentiment through third-party engagement surveys. In 2020, 72% of our people participated in the survey. After each survey, we develop and communicate clear action plans to continue to build on our strengths and address shortfalls.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
As a result of the size, breadth and geographic diversity of our business, our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including with respect to import and export controls, temporary work authorizations or work permits and other immigration laws, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, anti-corruption, the environment, government affairs, internal and disclosure control obligations, data privacy, intellectual property, employee and labor relations.

The Southern Company System
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see "Territory Served by the Southern Company System – Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power" herein.
Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into from time to time for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into various reliability agreements with certain neighboring utilities, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission

facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Southern Company recently joined a filing at the FERC proposing a Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) that includes many of the electric service providers in the Southeast. SEEM is an extension of the existing bilateral market where participants would use an automated, intra-hour energy exchange to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. If approved by the FERC, SEEM is expected to begin service in early 2022. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or Southern Company power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the Southern Company power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the Southern Company power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the Southern Company power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from Southern Company power pool transactions with third parties. In connection with the sale of former subsidiary Gulf Power in January 2019, an appendix was added to the IIC setting forth terms and conditions governing Gulf Power's continued participation in the IIC for a defined transition period that, subject to certain potential adjustments, is scheduled to end on January 1, 2024.
Southern Power and Southern Linc have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished in compliance with FERC regulations.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have agreements with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has an agreement with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation – Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional information.
Southern Power
Southern Power develops, constructs, acquires, owns, and manages power generation assets, including renewable energy and battery energy storage projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions, dispositions, and sales of partnership interests, development and construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs, including contracts for differences that provide the owner of a renewable facility a certain fixed price for electricity sold to the grid, primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load-serving entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers. The electricity from the natural gas generating facilities owned by Southern Power is primarily sold under long-term, fixed-price capacity PPAs both with unaffiliated wholesale purchasers as well as with the traditional electric operating companies. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to develop and construct generating facilities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – OVERVIEW – "Business Activities" in Item 7 herein.
Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the Southern Company power pool, and has various subsidiaries whose generation assets are not included in the Southern Company power pool. These subsidiaries were created to own, operate, and pursue natural gas and renewable generation facilities either wholly or in partnership with various third parties. At December 31, 2020, Southern Power's generation fleet, which is owned in part with various partners, totaled 11,920 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 4,540 MWs of nameplate capacity owned by its subsidiaries). See "Traditional Electric Operating Companies" herein for additional information on the Southern Company power pool.
I-2
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
A majority of Southern Power's partnerships in renewable facilities allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages, with Southern Power being the controlling member and thus consolidating the assets and operations of the partnerships. At December 31, 2020, Southern Power had six tax-equity partnership arrangements where the tax-equity investors receive substantially all of the tax benefits from the facilities, including ITCs and PTCs. In addition, Southern Power holds controlling interests in eight partnerships in solar facilities through SP Solar. For seven of these solar partnerships, Southern Power and its 33% partner, Global Atlantic, are entitled to 51% of all cash distributions and the respective partner that holds the Class B membership interests is entitled to 49% of all cash distributions. For the Desert Stateline partnership, Southern Power and Global Atlantic are entitled to 66% of all cash distributions and the Class B member is entitled to 34% of all cash distributions. In addition, Southern Power and Global Atlantic are entitled to substantially all of the federal tax benefits with respect to these eight partnership entities.
See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein and Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, dispositions, construction, and development projects.
Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets, including those owned with various partners, based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of investments associated with the facilities currently under construction, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power's average investment coverage ratio at December 31, 2020 was 94% through 2025 and 91% through 2030, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 14 years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 69% of contracted MWs were with AAA to A- or equivalent rated counterparties, 21% were with BBB+ to BBB- or equivalent rated counterparties, and 8% were either with unrated entities that have ratemaking authority or those who have posted collateral to cover potential credit exposure.
Southern Power's electricity sales from natural gas generating facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serves the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable. Capacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year and to provide a return on investment.
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind (renewable) generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the renewable energy credits.
Southern Power actively pursues replacement PPAs prior to the expiration of its current PPAs and anticipates that the revenues attributable to one customer may be replaced by revenues from a new customer; however, the expiration of any of Southern Power's current PPAs without the successful remarketing of a replacement PPA could have a material negative impact on Southern Power's earnings but is not expected to have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings.
Southern Company Gas
Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas, including gas pipeline investments, wholesale gas services, and gas marketing services. Southern Company Gas also has an "all other" non-reportable segment that includes segments below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure, including storage operations and subsidiaries that fall below the quantitative threshold for separate disclosure. See Note 15 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for information regarding Southern Company Gas' dispositions during 2020.
Gas distribution operations, the largest segment of Southern Company Gas' business, operates, constructs, and maintains approximately 75,924 miles of natural gas pipelines and 14 storage facilities, with total capacity of 157 Bcf, to provide natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Gas distribution operations serves approximately 4.3 million customers across four states.
I-3
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Gas pipeline investments primarily consists of joint ventures in natural gas pipeline investments including a 50% interest in SNG, a 20% ownership interest in the PennEast Pipeline project, and a 50% joint ownership interest in the Dalton Pipeline. These natural gas pipelines enable the provision of diverse sources of natural gas supplies to the customers of Southern Company Gas. SNG, the largest natural gas pipeline investment, is the owner of a 7,000-mile pipeline connecting natural gas supply basins in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama to markets in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee.

See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY in Item 7 herein and Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information concerning financing programs.
Fuel Supply
Electric
The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION – "Southern Company – Electricity Business – Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – RESULTS OF OPERATION under "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" for each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2019 and 2020.
SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2021, SCS has contracted for 574 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 13 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.
The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their 2021 coal burn requirements. These agreements have terms ranging between one and three years. Fuel procurement specifications, emission allowances, environmental control systems, and fuel changes have allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by applicable environmental regulations. As new environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein for additional information.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication with remaining terms ranging from one to 14 years. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units. Alabama Power and Georgia Power also have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See "Rate Matters – Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's natural gas PPAs generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.
Natural Gas
Advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the United States have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and low prices for natural gas. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the regulatory agencies in the states where Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and, for the natural gas distribution utilities other than Nicor Gas, from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sequent, under asset management agreements approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release

Competition
Electric
The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.
The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to standards set forth in this Act, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice.
Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may extend or maintain its electric system subject to certain regulatory approvals; extensions of facilities by such utility, or extensions of facilities into that area by other utilities, may not be made unless the Mississippi PSC grants a CPCN. Areas included in a CPCN that are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the CPCN, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.
Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors.
Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales across various U.S. utility markets. The needs of these markets are driven by the demands of end users and the generation available. Southern Power's success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs.
As of December 31, 2020, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with seven industrial customers. Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2020, Alabama Power purchased approximately 107 million KWHs from such companies at a cost of $3 million.
As of December 31, 2020, Georgia Power had contracts in effect to purchase generation from 36 small IPPs. During 2020, Georgia Power purchased 4.5 billion KWHs from such companies at a cost of $253 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity with five cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2020, Georgia Power purchased 416 million KWHs at a cost of $34 million from these facilities.
As of December 31, 2020, Mississippi Power had a cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2020, Mississippi Power did not make any such purchases.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance.
Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment.

Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including:
•changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy;
•general economic conditions;
•energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs;
•legislation and regulations;
•the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and
•technological changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances.
The natural gas-related programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances.
The availability and affordability of natural gas have provided cost advantages and further opportunity for growth of the businesses.
Seasonality and Demand
The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. While the electric power sales of some electric utilities peak in the summer, others peak in the winter. In the aggregate, during normal weather conditions, the Southern Company system's electric power sales peak during both the summer and winter. In most of the areas Southern Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of the Registrants in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, the Subsidiary Registrants have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "General" and – RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – "Southern Company Gas – Seasonality of Results" in Item 7 herein for information regarding trends in market demand for electricity and natural gas and the impact of seasonality on Southern Company Gas' business, respectively.
Regulation
States
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See "Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information.
Federal Power Act
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2020, among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1.7 million KWs and 17 existing Georgia Power generating stations and one generating station partially owned by Georgia Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of 1.1 million KWs.
In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. In 2016, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. American Rivers and Alabama Rivers Alliance also filed multiple appeals of the FERC's 2013 order for the new 30-year license and, in 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the order and remanded the proceeding to the FERC. Alabama Power continues to operate the Coosa River developments under annual licenses issued by the FERC. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.

    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
In 2020, Alabama Power continued the process of developing an application to relicense the Harris Dam project on the Tallapoosa River, which is expected to be filed with the FERC by November 30, 2021. The current Harris Dam project license will expire on November 30, 2023.
In 2020, the FERC issued a new 40-year license to Georgia Power for the Wallace Dam project on the Oconee River. In 2018, Georgia Power filed a Notice of Intent to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project on the Ocmulgee River. The application to relicense the Lloyd Shoals project is expected to be filed with the FERC by December 31, 2021. The current Lloyd Shoals project license will expire on December 31, 2023. Also in 2018, Georgia Power filed applications to surrender the Langdale and Riverview hydroelectric projects on the Chattahoochee River upon their license expirations on December 31, 2023. Both projects together represent 1,520 KWs of Georgia Power's hydro fleet capacity.
Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2026, for the Rocky Mountain project, a pure pumped storage facility of 903,000 KW installed capacity. See PROPERTIES – "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2034-2066 in the case of Alabama Power's projects and in the years 2035-2044 in the case of Georgia Power's projects.
Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result in additional costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Nuclear Regulation
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment, protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity with antitrust laws.
The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. The NRC licenses for Alabama Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037 and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively.
In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs allowed full construction to begin. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
See Notes 3 and 6 to the financial statements under "Nuclear Insurance" and "Nuclear Decommissioning," respectively, in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Environmental Laws and Regulations
See "Construction Programs" herein, MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein, and Note 3 to the financial statements under "Environmental Remediation" and Note 6 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for information concerning environmental laws and regulations impacting the Registrants.
Rate Matters
Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans
Electric
The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with
I-10
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval.
The traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at Georgia Power through periodic base rate proceedings.
See Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also see "Integrated Resource Planning" herein for additional information.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.
Mississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 15.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2020 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC.
In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Southern Company Gas" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms.
Integrated Resource Planning
Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL – "Environmental Matters" in Item 7 herein for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies.
Alabama Power
Triennially, Alabama Power provides an IRP report to the Alabama PSC. This report overviews Alabama Power's resource planning process and contains information that serves as the foundation for certain decisions affecting Alabama Power's portfolio of supply-side and demand-side resources. The IRP report facilitates Alabama Power's ability to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to customers, while accounting for the risks and uncertainties inherent in planning for resources sufficient to meet expected customer demand. Under State of Alabama law, a CCN must be obtained from the Alabama PSC before Alabama Power constructs any new generating facility, unless such construction is an ordinary extension of an existing
I-11
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
system in the usual course of business. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Alabama Power – Petition for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Georgia Power
Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electric service needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Georgia Power – Rate Plans." Also see Note 2 to the financial statements under and "Georgia Power – Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information on the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act and the Georgia PSC certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which allow Georgia Power to recover certain financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.
Mississippi Power
In November 2019, the Mississippi PSC established the Integrated Resource Planning and Reporting Rule (IRP Rule), which is intended to allow electric utilities the flexibility to formulate long-term plans to best meet the needs of their customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources and considering transmission needs. The IRP Rule establishes reporting requirements that include the triennial filing of an IRP, with supply-side updates midway through the three-year cycle, and an annual report on energy delivery improvements. The IRP filing is not intended to supplant or replace the Mississippi PSC's existing regulatory processes for petition and approval of CPCNs for new generating resources. Mississippi Power will file its first triennial IRP in compliance with the IRP Rule in April 2021.
See Note 2 to the financial statements under "Mississippi Power – Reserve Margin Plan" in Item 8 herein for information regarding an order issued by the Mississippi PSC on December 17, 2020 requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027 to reduce Mississippi Power's excess reserve margin.
Human Capital
Southern Company system management is committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a sustainable workforce and aims to foster a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and innovative culture. The Southern Company system's values – safety first, unquestionable trust, superior performance, and total commitment – guide behavior. The Southern Company system had approximately 27,700 employees on its payroll at December 31, 2020 comprised of the following:
At December 31, 2020(*)
Alabama Power	6,200	Georgia Power	6,700	Mississippi Power	1,000	Southern Power	400	Southern Company Gas	4,500	SCS	3,800	Southern Nuclear	4,000	PowerSecure and other	1,100	Total Southern Company system	27,700 
(*)Numbers are rounded to 100s.
All Southern Company system employees are located within the United States. Part-time employees represent less than 1% of total employees.
Southern Company system management values a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workforce. Southern Company's subsidiaries have policies, programs, and processes to help ensure that all groups are represented, included, and fairly treated across all job levels. The Southern Company Board of Directors and management believe that diversity is important to provide different perspectives on risk, business strategy, and innovation. Southern Company management leads the Southern Company system's diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and employee recruitment, retention, and development efforts. The Board, principally through its Compensation and Management Succession Committee, oversees these efforts. At December 31, 2020, people of color and women represented 28% and 25%, respectively, of the Southern Company system's workforce.
I-12
    Table of Contents                                Index to Financial Statements
Southern Company system management recognizes the importance of attracting and retaining an appropriately qualified workforce. Southern Company system management uses a variety of strategies to attract and retain talent, including working with high schools, technical schools, universities, and military installations to fill many entry-level positions. The recruiting strategy also includes partnerships with professional associations and local communities to recruit mid-career talent. The addition of external hires augments the existing workforce to meet changing business needs, address any critical skill gaps, and supplement and diversify the Southern Company system's talent pipeline.
The Southern Company system supports the well-being of its employees through a total rewards strategy with three measurable categories: physical, financial, and emotional well-being. The Southern Company system provides competitive salaries, annual incentive awards for nearly all employees, and health, welfare, and retirement benefits. The Southern Company system has a qualified defined benefit, trusteed pension plan and a qualified defined contribution, trusteed 401(k) plan which provides a competitive company matching contribution. Substantially all Southern Company system employees are eligible to participate in these plans. There are differences between the pension plan benefit formulas based on when and by which subsidiary an employee is hired. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information. At December 31, 2020, the average age of the Southern Company system employees was 45 and the average tenure with the Southern Company system was 15 years. Turnover rate, calculated as the percent of employees that terminated employment with the Southern Company system, including voluntary and involuntary terminations and retirements, divided by total employees, was 5.7%.
Southern Company system management is committed to developing talent and helping employees succeed by providing development opportunities along with purposeful people moves as part of individual development plans and succession planning processes. The Southern Company system has multiple development programs, including programs targeted toward all employees, high potential employees, first-level managers, managers of managers, and executives. Additionally, Southern Company system management strives to deliver consistent needs-based training and solutions as workplace needs evolve.
Southern Company system management believes the safety of employees and customers is paramount. The Southern Company system seeks to meet or exceed applicable laws and regulations while continually improving its safety technologies and processes. The Southern Company System Safety and Health Council, which includes leaders from each Registrant, works collectively across the Southern Company system to provide safety leadership, share learning, work collaboratively to address safety-related issues, and govern the consistency of safety programs. The safety programs are focused on the prevention and elimination of life-altering events, serious injuries, and fatalities. These programs include continuous process improvements to put critical controls in place to prevent serious injuries, promote learning, and implement appropriate corrective actions. In 2020, the Southern Company system had a serious injury rate of 0.10, which represent the number of incidents per 100 employees (calculated by taking the number of serious injuries multiplied by 200,000 workhours and divided by the total employee workhours during the year). A serious injury is one that is life-threatening or life-changing for the employee. Serious injury examples, as defined by applicable safety regulators, include fatalities, amputations, trauma to organs, certain bone fractures, severe burns, and eye injuries.
Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the Southern Company system has continued to provide essential services to customers while protecting employees, customers, and communities by implementing applicable business continuity plans, including teleworking, canceling nonessential business travel, increasing cleaning frequency at business locations, implementing applicable safety and health guidelines issued by federal, state, and local officials, and establishing protocols for required work on customer premises. To date, these procedures have been effective in maintaining the Southern Company system's critical operations, while also emphasizing employee, customer, and community safety.
The Southern Company system also has longstanding relationships with labor unions. The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Nuclear, and the natural gas distribution utilities have separate agreements with local unions of the IBEW, which generally apply to operating, maintenance, and construction employees. These agreements cover wages, benefits, terms of the pension plans, working conditions, and procedures for handling grievances and arbitration. The Southern Company system also partners with the IBEW to provide training programs to develop technical skills and career opportunities.
At December 31, 2020, approximately 32% of Southern Company system employees were covered by agreements with unions, with agreements expiring between 2021 and 2025. Negotiations related to the agreement expiring in 2021 are expected to commence later in the first quarter 2021.

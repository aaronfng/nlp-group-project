OVERVIEW
We are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including linear platforms such as pay-television ("pay-TV"), free-to-air ("FTA") and broadcast television, authenticated GO applications, digital distribution arrangements, content licensing arrangements and direct-to-consumer ("DTC") subscription products. As one of the world’s largest pay-TV programmers, we provide original and purchased content and live events to approximately 3.7 billion cumulative subscribers and viewers worldwide through networks that we wholly or partially own. We distribute customized content in the U.S. and over 220 other countries and territories in nearly 50 languages. We have an extensive library of content and own most rights to our content and footage, which enables us to leverage our library to quickly launch brands and services into new markets and on new platforms. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms.
Our content spans genres including survival, natural history, exploration, sports, general entertainment, home, food, travel, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health, and kids. Our global portfolio of networks includes prominent nonfiction television brands such as Discovery Channel, our most widely distributed global brand, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Travel Channel, Science, and MotorTrend (previously known as Velocity domestically and currently known as Turbo in most international countries). Among other networks in the U.S., Discovery also features two Spanish-language services, Discovery en Español and Discovery Familia. Our international portfolio also includes Eurosport, a leading sports entertainment provider and broadcaster of the Olympic Games (the "Olympics") across Europe (excluding Russia), TVN, a Polish media company, as well as Discovery Kids, a leading children's entertainment brand in Latin America. We participate in joint ventures including Magnolia, the recently formed multi-platform venture with Chip and Joanna Gaines, and Group Nine Media ("Group Nine"), a digital media holding company home to top digital brands including NowThis News, the Dodo, Thrillist, PopSugar, and Seeker. We operate production studios, and prior to the sale of our Education Business in April 2018, we sold curriculum-based education products and services. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.)
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced the global launch of our aggregated DTC product, discovery+, a non-fiction, real life subscription service. In January 2021, we launched discovery+ in the U.S. across several streaming platforms and entered into a partnership with Verizon, which is offering access to discovery+ for up to 12 months to certain of its customers. The global rollout of discovery+ across more than 25 markets has already begun with the U.K. and Ireland, where we have partnered with Sky, and India. We also have a partnership with Vodafone, which will provide discovery+ to existing Vodafone TV and mobile customers in 12 markets across Europe. Upon launch in the U.S., discovery+ included an extensive content library comprised of more than 55,000 episodes and features a wide array of exclusive, original series from the Discovery portfolio of brands that have a strong leadership position. The service is available with ads or on an ad-free tier, providing Discovery with dual revenue streams.
We aim to generate revenues principally from the sale of advertising on our networks and digital products and from fees charged to distributors that carry our network brands and content, primarily including cable, direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite, telecommunication and digital service providers, as well as through DTC subscription services. Other transactions include affiliate and advertising sales representation services, production studios content development and services content licenses, the licensing of our brands for consumer products, and in 2018, curriculum-based products and services. During 2020, advertising, distribution and other revenues were 52%, 46% and 2%, respectively, of consolidated revenues. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues for 2020, 2019 or 2018.
We invest in high-quality content for our networks and brands with the objective of building viewership, optimizing distribution revenue, capturing advertising revenue, and creating or repositioning branded channels and business to sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. Our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we have extended content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, online streaming, mobile devices, video on demand (“VOD”), and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, DTH satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors who deliver our content to their customers.

Although we utilize certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: U.S. Networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and digital content services, and International Networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and digital content services. Our segment presentation aligns with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. Financial information for our segments and the geographical areas in which we do business is set forth in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Network Brands
Subscriber statistics set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include both wholly-owned networks and networks operated by equity method investees. Domestic subscriber statistics are based on Nielsen Media Research. International subscriber and viewer statistics are derived from internal data coupled with external sources when available. As used herein, a “subscriber” is a single household that receives the applicable network from its cable television operator, DTH satellite operator, telecommunication service provider, or other television provider, including those who receive our networks from pay-TV providers without charge pursuant to various pricing plans that include free periods and/or free carriage. The term “cumulative subscribers” refers to the sum of the total number of subscribers to each of our networks or content services. By way of example, two households that each receive five of our networks from their pay-TV provider represent two subscribers, but 10 cumulative subscribers. The term "viewer" is a single household that receives the signal from one of our networks using the appropriate receiving equipment without a subscription to a pay-TV provider.
Our brands consist of the following:

U.S. NETWORKS
U.S. Networks generated revenues of $6.9 billion and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted OIBDA") of $4.0 billion during 2020, which represented 65% and 95% of our total consolidated revenues and Adjusted OIBDA, respectively. Our U.S. Networks segment principally consists of national television networks. Our U.S. Networks segment owns and operates 17 national television networks, including fully distributed television networks such as Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, and Animal Planet. In addition, we operate the following U.S. Networks: MotorTrend, Investigation Discovery, Travel Channel, Science, Discovery Family, American Heroes Channel, Destination America, Discovery Life, DIY Network, Cooking Channel, Great American Country, and OWN. In 2020, we also provided authenticated U.S. TV Everywhere ("TVE") streaming products that are available to pay-TV subscribers and connect viewers through our GO applications with live and on-demand access to award-winning shows and series from 16 U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio and from Discovery Familia and Discovery en Español. During 2020, we achieved incremental increases in U.S. digital platform consumption. Furthermore, we provide certain networks to consumers as part of subscription-based over-the-top services provided by DirectTV Now, AT&T Watch, Hulu, SlingTV, fuboTV, and YouTube TV.
U.S. Networks generates revenues from fees charged to distributors of our television networks’ first run content, which includes cable, DTH satellite and telecommunication service providers, referred to as affiliate fees; fees from distributors for licensed content and content to equity method investee networks, referred to as other distribution revenue; fees from advertising sold on our television networks and digital products, which include discovery+, our GO suite of TVE applications and other DTC subscription products; fees from providing sales representation, network distribution services; and revenue from licensing our brands for consumer products. Typically, our television networks are aired pursuant to multi-year carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that our networks will receive and for annual graduated rate increases. Carriage of our networks depends on package inclusion, such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed, broader packages or lesser-distributed, specialized packages, also referred to as digital tiers. In the U.S., approximately 95% of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors, with whom we have agreements that expire at various times. Distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year. Certain of our DTC products, including the recent launch of our aggregated discovery+ service in January 2021, provide dual revenue streams.
Advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and is based on the price received for available advertising spots and is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our programming, our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels and leverage multiple platforms to connect advertisers to target audiences. In the U.S., advertising time is sold in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. Many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce or increase purchase commitments. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run, which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time that upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile.
During 2020, advertising, distribution and other revenues were 58%, 41% and 1%, respectively, of total net revenues for this segment.
INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS
International Networks generated revenues of $3.7 billion and Adjusted OIBDA of $723 million during 2020, which represented 35% and 17% of our total consolidated revenues and Adjusted OIBDA, respectively. Our International Networks segment principally consists of national and pan-regional television networks and brands that are delivered across multiple distribution platforms. This segment generates revenue from operations in virtually every pay-TV market in the world through an infrastructure that includes operational centers in London, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Milan, Singapore and Miami. Global brands include Discovery Channel, Food Network, HGTV, Animal Planet, TLC, ID, Science and MotorTrend (known as Turbo outside of the U.S.), along with brands exclusive to International Networks, including Eurosport, Discovery Kids, DMAX, Discovery Home & Health, and TVN. TVN was acquired in March 2018, as part of our acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. (the "Scripps Acquisition"). As of December 31, 2020, International Networks operates unique distribution feeds in nearly 50 languages with channel feeds customized according to language needs and advertising sales opportunities. International Networks also has FTA networks in Europe and the Middle East and broadcast networks in Poland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland, and continues to pursue further international expansion. During 2020, we completed the acquisition of a German free-to-air general entertainment TV channel and completed an acquisition of an independent free-to-air commercial broadcaster in New Zealand.

FTA and broadcast networks generate a significant portion of International Networks' revenue. The penetration and growth rates of television services vary across countries and territories depending on numerous factors including the dominance of different television platforms in local markets. While pay-TV services have greater penetration in certain markets, FTA or broadcast television is dominant in others. International Networks has a large international distribution platform with more than 80 networks, with as many as 23 networks distributed in any particular country or territory across more than 220 countries and territories around the world. International Networks pursues distribution across all television platforms based on the specific dynamics of local markets and relevant commercial agreements.
With the growing demand for consumer content on digital and mobile devices, a suite of international DTC products has been made available to consumers. dplay, our real-life entertainment streaming service, was rebranded to our new global streaming service, discovery+, in the UK and Ireland during the fourth quarter of 2020. The remainder of the dplay markets, including the Nordics, Italy, Spain, and the Netherlands, are expected to follow in 2021. Discovery expects to expand its DTC offering across more than 25 key markets in 2021 by leveraging its library of local-language content, as well as its broad portfolio of live sports. Eurosport’s existing streaming service, Eurosport Player, offers premium and localized sports to fans in 52 markets in Europe. This service is expected to continue to be available until discovery+ launches and Eurosport Player's content is fully integrated onto the service in those markets.
Beginning with Tokyo 2020, scheduled for the summer of 2021, discovery+ will become the streaming home of the Olympics in Europe (excluding Russia) with live and on-demand access. Eurosport will be an official broadcaster of the Olympics in France and the U.K. for Tokyo 2020.
In Germany, we have partnered with ProSiebenSat.1 to launch the streaming service, Joyn, which offers a collection of free-TV content, with programming and live streams from more than 70 channels. In Poland, we have partnered with Cyfrow Polsat to create a video streaming platform that, when launched, following regulatory clearance, will give viewers a single destination to access Polish content including movies, series, documentaries, sports and entertainment.
Effective September 2020, the Company realigned its International Networks management reporting structure. As a result, Australia and New Zealand, which were previously included in the Europe reporting unit, are now included in the Asia-Pacific reporting unit.

Similar to U.S. Networks, a significant source of revenue for International Networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks. Such operators primarily include cable and DTH satellite service providers. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some markets, such as the U.K., are more advanced digital television markets, while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies. Common practice in some markets results in long-term contractual distribution relationships, while customers in other markets renew contracts annually. Distribution revenue for our International Networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements, and the market demand for the content that we provide. International Networks additionally generates revenues through DTC subscription services.
15

The other significant source of revenue for International Networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across distribution platforms, similar to U.S. Networks. Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the development of pay and FTA television markets, the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our programming, and our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels on multiple platforms. In certain markets, our advertising sales business operates with in-house sales teams, while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets. Outside the U.S., advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run. In developing pay-TV markets, we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth, our localization strategy, and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay-TV. In mature markets, such as Western Europe, high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth. Instead, growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services, either in pay-TV, broadcast, or FTA television environments.
During 2020, advertising, distribution and other revenues were 42%, 54% and 3%, respectively, of total net revenues for this segment. While we have traditionally operated cable networks, in recent years an increasing portion of our international advertising revenue is generated by FTA or broadcast networks, unlike U.S. Networks. During 2020, pay-TV networks generated 33% of International Networks' advertising revenue and FTA or broadcast networks generated 67% of International Networks' advertising revenue. We also have increased efforts to drive revenue growth from digital products such as the dplay DTC entertainment service in select international markets.
International Networks' largest cost is content expense for localized programming. While our International Networks segment maximizes the use of programming from U.S. Networks, we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films, television series and sporting events from third parties. Content acquired from U.S. Networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly, as amortization rates vary by network.
While International Networks and U.S. Networks have similarities with respect to the nature of operations, the generation of revenue and the categories of expense, International Networks have a lower segment margin due to lower economies of scale from being in over 220 markets which requires additional cost for localization to satisfy market variations. International Networks also include sports and FTA broadcast channels, which drive higher costs from sports rights and production and investment in broad entertainment programming for broadcast networks.
In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” E.U. law provides for a departing member state to have a two-year notice period to negotiate a term of exit, which the U.K. triggered in March 2017 and subsequently extended. In October 2019, a revised draft withdrawal agreement was published detailing the framework of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. This agreement was ratified by the U.K. and European Parliaments and on January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally left the E.U. Brexit may have an adverse impact on advertising, subscribers, distributors and employees, as described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. The withdrawal agreement included a transitional period until December 2020. Discovery, like many international media businesses, sought to mitigate this risk by applying for broadcast licenses in remaining E.U. member states, thereby allowing us continued access to the E.U. single market. We have been operating our E.U. pay-TV channels under Dutch jurisdiction since March 2019. Most of our E.U. free to air channels which were previously operating under the U.K. authority, Ofcom, are operating under German jurisdiction as of January 1, 2021. We continue to monitor the situation for potential effects on our distribution and licensing agreements, unusual foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and changes to the legal and regulatory landscape.
CONTENT DEVELOPMENT
Our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership, maintain innovation and quality leadership, and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers. Our content is sourced from a wide range of third-party producers, which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies, as well as independent producers and wholly-owned production studios.
Our production arrangements fall into three categories: produced, coproduced and licensed. Produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce. We retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights, in exchange for paying all development and production costs. Production of digital-first content such as virtual reality and short-form video is typically done through wholly-owned production studios. Coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because world-wide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties. Licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties. Payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets.

International Networks maximizes the use of content from our U.S. Networks. Our non-fiction content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time. As a result, a significant amount of our non-fiction content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world. International Networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from U.S. Networks, customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds. While our International Networks segment maximizes the use of content from U.S. Networks, we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films, television series and sporting events from third-party producers. To that end, during 2018, we entered into a 12-year partnership with the PGA Tour that includes TV and online rights to the PGA Tour outside the United States. Effective January 1, 2019, we announced the launch of GOLFTV, a new live and on-demand international video streaming service providing over 2,000 hours of live golf programming each year and extensive premium content on-demand. Discovery expects to invest more than $2 billion over the course of the partnership, including licensing rights and building the GOLFTV platform.
Our largest single expense is content, which includes content amortization, content impairment and production costs. We amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current year's estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues, which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives. However, certain networks also utilize a straight-line method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content. Content is amortized primarily over periods of two to four years. The costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement. Content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present, such as low viewership or limited expected use. Impairment losses are recorded when content asset carrying value exceeds net realizable value.
COMPETITION
Providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of our content, sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership. There is competition from other production studios, other television networks, and online-based content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our content, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide.
Our networks compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local, for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of original content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage.
Our networks and digital products compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks, including broadcast, cable, local networks, and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by third-party research companies, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace.
Our networks and DTC products also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast, cable and local networks, streaming services, pay-per-view and VOD services, DVDs, online activities and other forms of news, information and entertainment.
Our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our intellectual property assets include copyrights in content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, technology platforms, websites, and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties.
17

We are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance. We have also made and will continue to make investments in developing technology platforms to support our digital products and DTC offerings and consider these platforms to be one of our intellectual property assets. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and Internet/domain name statutes and laws, and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not be effective.
Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content, in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property. We use external vendors to detect and remove infringing content and leverage our membership in a range of industry groups to address piracy issues.
REGULATORY MATTERS
Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies, such as the E.U., in which we operate. Content networks, such as those owned by us, are regulated by the FCC including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator. Other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") operators and other distributors, affect content networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. These descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
Program Access
The FCC’s program access rules prevent a satellite-delivered content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable and DBS operators, in the rates, terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content. These rules permit the unaffiliated MVPD to initiate a complaint to the FCC against content networks if it believes this rule has been violated.
Program Carriage
The FCC recently made changes to the program carriage rules, which prohibit distributors from favoring their affiliated content networks over unaffiliated similarly situated content networks in the rates, terms and conditions of carriage agreements between content networks and cable operators or other MVPDs. Some of these changes could make it more difficult for us to challenge a distributor’s decision to decline to carry one of our content networks or a distributor's actions mid-contract that discriminate against one of our content networks.
“Must-Carry”/Retransmission Consent
The Communications Act (the “Act”) imposes “must-carry” regulations on cable systems, requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market. DBS systems are also subject to their own must-carry rules. The FCC’s implementation of “must-carry” obligations requires cable operators and DBS providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions. This reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and DBS operators. The Act also gives broadcasters the choice of opting out of must-carry and invoking the right to retransmission consent, which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require MVPDs, such as cable and satellite operators, to obtain the broadcaster's consent before distributing the broadcaster's signal to the MVPDs' subscribers, often at a substantial cost that reduces the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters, such as us.
Accessibility, Children's Advertising Restrictions, and CALM Act
Certain of our content networks and some of our IP-delivered video content must provide closed-captioning and audio description of some of their programming. Our content networks and digital products intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising. Commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream also must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material.
18

Obscenity Restrictions
Network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content, and our distribution agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks.
Regulation of Digital Services
We operate a variety of free, advertising-based and subscription-based digital products and services providing information, entertainment, e-commerce and interactive experiences to consumers in the U.S. and international markets via web, mobile and connected TV platforms. Our digital services are subject to federal and state regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personal information collected from our users, including laws pertaining to the acquisition of personal information from children under 13, such as the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, and that impose data security and security breach obligations on the Company. These laws are continually evolving, with robust new data protection frameworks having been introduced during the past few years in both the U.S. and international markets, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and Brazil’s General Data Protection Law. Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to our digital services, covering such issues as data privacy and security, child safety, oversight of user-generated content, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. Our digital products and services available to consumers in international markets are also subject to the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer protection, data privacy and security, advertising, intellectual property, and content limitations. We must design and operate our digital products and websites in compliance with these laws and regulations.
Foreign Laws and Regulations
The foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses.

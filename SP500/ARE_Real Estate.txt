Overview


We are a Maryland corporation formed in October 1994 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We are an S&P 500® urban office REIT and the first, longest-tenured, and pioneering owner, operator, and developer uniquely focused on collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations. We consider AAA locations to be highly desirable for tenancy by life science, technology, and agtech entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Such locations are generally characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space. Founded in 1994, Alexandria pioneered this niche and has since established a significant market presence in key locations, including Greater Boston, San Francisco, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland, and Research Triangle.


Alexandria develops dynamic urban cluster campuses and vibrant ecosystems that enable and inspire the world’s most brilliant minds and innovative companies to create life-changing scientific and technological breakthroughs. We believe in the utmost professionalism, humility, and teamwork. Alexandria manages its properties through fully integrated regional teams with real estate, life science, technology, and agtech expertise. Our tenants include multinational pharmaceutical companies; public and private biotechnology companies; life science product, service, and medical device companies; digital health, technology, and agtech companies; academic and medical research institutions; U.S. government research agencies; non-profit organizations; and venture capital firms. Alexandria has a longstanding and proven track record of developing Class A properties clustered in urban life science, technology, and agtech campuses that provide its innovative tenants with highly dynamic and collaborative environments that enhance their ability to successfully recruit and retain world-class talent and inspire productivity, efficiency, creativity, and success. Alexandria also provides strategic risk capital to transformative life science, technology, and agtech companies through its venture capital arm. We believe our unique business model and diligent underwriting ensure a high-quality and diverse tenant base that should result in higher occupancy levels, longer lease terms, higher rental income, higher returns, and greater long-term asset value. 


As of December 31, 2020, Alexandria’s total market capitalization was $31.9 billion. For the definition of “Total market capitalization,” refer to the “Non-GAAP measures and definitions” section under Item 7 in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our asset base in North America consisted of 49.7 million SF, which includes 31.9 million RSF of operating properties and 3.3 million RSF of Class A properties undergoing construction, 7.1 million RSF of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects, and 7.4 million SF of future development projects as of December 31, 2020. These operating properties and development projects include 40 properties that are held by consolidated real estate joint ventures and six properties that are held by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures. The occupancy percentage of our operating properties in North America was 94.6% as of December 31, 2020. Our 10-year average occupancy rate of operating properties as of December 31, 2020, was 96%. Investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants represented 55% of our annual rental revenue in effect as of December 31, 2020. Additional information regarding our consolidated and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures is included in “Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on Form 10-K. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included in “Item 1A. Risk factors” and “Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Business objective and strategies


Our primary business objective is to maximize long-term asset value and shareholder returns based on a multifaceted platform of internal and external growth. A key element of our strategy is our unique focus on Class A properties clustered in urban campuses located in AAA innovation cluster locations. These key urban campus locations are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords, high barriers to exit for tenants, and a limited supply of available space. They represent highly desirable locations for tenancy by life science, technology, and agtech entities because of their close proximity to concentrations of specialized skills, knowledge, institutions, and related businesses. Our strategy also includes drawing upon our deep and broad real estate, life science, technology, and agtech relationships in order to identify and attract new and leading tenants and to source additional value-creation real estate.


Our tenant base is broad and diverse within the life science, technology, and agtech industries and reflects our focus on regional, national, and international tenants with substantial financial and operational resources. For a more detailed description of our properties and tenants, refer to “Item 2. Properties” in this annual report on Form 10-K. We have an experienced Board of Directors and are led by an executive and senior management team with extensive experience in the real estate, life science, technology, and agtech industries.


Acquisitions


We seek to identify and acquire high-quality properties in our target cluster markets. Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective property or properties, including:


•Proximity to centers of innovation and technological advances;
•Location of the property and our strategy in the relevant market;
•Quality of existing and prospective tenants;
•Condition and capacity of the building infrastructure;
•Physical condition of the structure and common area improvements;
•Quality and generic characteristics of the improvements;
•Opportunities available for leasing vacant space and for re-tenanting or renewing occupied space;
•Availability of and/or ability to add appropriate tenant amenities;
•Availability of land for future ground-up development of new space;
•Opportunities to generate higher rent through redevelopment of existing space;
•The property’s unlevered yields; and
•Our ability to increase the property’s long-term financial returns.


Development, pre-construction, and redevelopment


A key component of our business model is our value-creation development projects. Our development strategy is primarily to pursue selective projects with significant pre-leasing for which we expect to achieve appropriate investment returns and generally match a source of funds for this use. Our value-creation development projects focus on high-quality, generic, and reusable office/laboratory or tech office space to meet the real estate requirements of our diverse group of tenants.


We seek to meet growing demand from our stakeholders and continuously improve the efficiency of our buildings. We have committed to significant building goals to promote wellness and productivity for our buildings’ occupants, including targeting a minimum of LEED® Gold certification on all new ground-up construction projects. 


Pre-construction activities include entitlements, permitting, design, site work, and other activities preceding commencement of construction of aboveground building improvements, which are focused on reducing the time required to deliver projects to prospective tenants. These critical activities add significant value to our future ground-up development and are required for the vertical construction of buildings. We normally do not commence vertical construction of new projects prior to achieving significant pre-leasing. 


Another key component of our business model is our value-creation redevelopment of existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into high-quality, generic, and reusable office/laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental rates. Our redevelopment strategy generally includes significant pre-leasing of projects prior to the commencement of redevelopment.

Non-real estate investments


We also hold equity investments in publicly traded companies, limited partnerships, and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science, technology, and agtech industries. We invest primarily in highly innovative entities whose focus on the development of therapies and products that advance health and transform patients’ lives is aligned with Alexandria’s purpose of making a positive and meaningful impact on the health, safety, and well-being of the global community. Our status as a REIT limits our ability to make such non-real estate investments. Therefore, we conduct, and will continue to conduct, our non-real estate investment activities in a manner that complies with REIT requirements. 


Balance sheet and financial strategy


We seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders through the ownership, operation, management, and selective acquisition, development, and redevelopment of office/laboratory and tech office space, as well as the management of our balance sheet. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility, cash flows, and cash available for distribution to our stockholders by:


•Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital, including operating cash flows after dividends, incremental debt, asset sales, and other capital such as the sale of equity or joint venture capital;
•Maintaining significant liquidity through borrowing capacity under our unsecured senior line of credit and commercial paper program, marketable securities, issuances of forward equity contracts from time to time, and cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash;
•Continuing to improve our credit profile;
•Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;
•Maintaining commitment to long-term capital to fund growth;
•Maintaining low to modest leverage;
•Minimizing variable interest rate risk;
•Generating high-quality, strong, and increasing operating cash flows;
•Selectively selling real estate assets, including land parcels and non-core/“core-like” operating assets, and reinvesting the proceeds into our highly leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects;
•Allocating capital to Class A properties located in collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in AAA urban innovation clusters;
•Maintaining geographic diversity in urban intellectual centers of innovation;
•Selectively acquiring high-quality office/laboratory and tech office space in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets at prices that enable us to realize attractive returns;
•Selectively developing properties in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets;
•Selectively redeveloping existing office, warehouse, or shell space, or newly acquired properties, into high-quality, generic, and reusable office/laboratory space that can be leased at higher rental rates in our target urban innovation cluster submarkets;
•Renewing existing tenant space at higher rental rates to the extent possible;
•Minimizing tenant improvement costs;
•Improving investment returns through the leasing of vacant space and the replacing of existing tenants with new tenants at higher rental rates;
•Executing leases with high-quality tenants and proactively monitoring tenant health;
•Maintaining solid occupancy while attaining high rental rates;
•Realizing contractual rental rate escalations; and
•Implementing effective cost control measures, including negotiating pass-through provisions in tenant leases for operating expenses and certain capital expenditures. 


Competition


In general, other office/laboratory and tech office properties are located in close proximity to our properties. The amount of rentable space available in any market could have a material effect on our ability to rent space and on the rental rates we can attain for our properties. In addition, we compete for investment opportunities with other REITs, insurance companies, pension and investment funds, private equity entities, partnerships, developers, investment companies, owners/occupants, and foreign investors. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to invest more than we can or accept more risk than we are willing to accept. These entities may be less sensitive to risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant or the overall expected returns from real estate investments. In addition, as a result of their financial resources, our competitors may offer more free rent concessions, lower rental rates, or higher tenant improvement allowances in order to attract tenants. These leasing incentives could hinder our ability to maintain or raise rents and attract or retain tenants. Competition may also reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities available to us or may increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell. Competition in acquiring existing properties and land, both from institutional capital sources and from other REITs, has been very strong over the past several years; however, we believe we have differentiated ourselves from our competitors. As the first and only publicly traded urban office REIT to focus primarily on the office/laboratory real estate niche, we provide world-class collaborative life science, technology, and agtech campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations and maintain and cultivate many of the most important and strategic relationships in the life science, technology, and agtech industries.

Financial information about our reportable segment


Refer to Note 2 – “Summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements under Item 15 in this annual report on Form 10-K for information about our one reportable segment.


Regulation


General


Properties in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances, and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe we have the necessary permits and approvals to operate each of our properties.


Americans with Disabilities Act


Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to permit access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to incur substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.


Environmental matters


Under various environmental protection laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property and may be required to investigate and remediate contamination located on or emanating from that property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and the liability may be joint and several. Previous owners may have used some of our properties for industrial and other purposes, so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or may materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease, or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.


Some of our properties may have asbestos-containing building materials. Environmental laws require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. These laws may also allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.


In addition, some of our tenants handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their routine operations at our properties. Environmental laws and regulations subject our tenants, and potentially us, to liability resulting from such activities. Environmental liabilities could also affect a tenant’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our tenants to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us against any related liabilities. 


Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on the properties in our portfolio. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties and do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations, or an asbestos survey. To date, these assessments have not revealed any material environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations. Nevertheless, it is possible that the assessments on our properties have not revealed all environmental conditions, liabilities, or compliance concerns that may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances, or regulations may also impose additional material environmental liabilities.


Insurance


With respect to our properties, we carry commercial general liability, all-risk property, and business interruption insurance, including loss of rental income coverage. We select policy specifications and insured limits that we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage. In addition, we have obtained earthquake insurance for certain properties located in the vicinity of known active earthquake zones in an amount and with deductibles we believe are commercially reasonable. We also carry environmental insurance and title insurance policies on our properties. We generally obtain title insurance policies when we acquire the property, with each policy covering an amount equal to the initial purchase price of each property. Accordingly, any of our title insurance policies may be in an amount less than the current value of the related property. Additional information regarding risk factors that may affect us is included in “Item 1A. Risk factors” in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Human Capital


As of December 31, 2020, we had 470 employees. We believe that we have good relations with our employees. We have adopted a Business Integrity Policy that applies to all of our employees, and its receipt and review by each employee is documented and verified annually. In order to promote an exceptional corporate culture, Alexandria continuously monitors employee satisfaction, seeks employee feedback, and seeks opportunities to enhance our offerings. We participate in annual performance reviews with our employees and conduct formal employee surveys, and our talent management team holds annual meetings with employees. The positive employee experience is evidenced by our low voluntary and total turnover rates (averaging 4.1% and 8.1%, respectively, over the last five years, from 2016 to 2020), which are well below the reported median voluntary and total turnover rates of 10% and 18.0%, respectively, in the Nareit 2020 Compensation & Benefits Survey (data for 2019). 


We have an exceptional track record of identifying highly qualified candidates for promotion from within the Company. Alexandria’s executive and senior management team, represented by our senior vice presidents and above, consists of 47 individuals, averaging 24 years of real estate experience, including 12 years with Alexandria. Our executive management team alone averages 17 years of experience with Alexandria. Alexandria’s executive and senior management team has unique experience and expertise in creating, owning, and operating highly dynamic and collaborative campuses in key urban life science, technology, and agtech cluster locations. Alexandria’s highly experienced management team also includes regional market directors with leading reputations and longstanding relationships within the life science, technology, and agtech communities in their respective urban innovation clusters. We believe that our expertise, experience, reputation, and key relationships in the real estate, life science, technology, and agtech industries provide Alexandria with significant competitive advantages in attracting new business opportunities.


At Alexandria, people come first. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we moved swiftly to support our employees’ medical, mental, emotional, physical, and financial health. Our commitment to our people has always been our primary focus, and we continue to devote extraordinary efforts to hire, develop, and retain a healthy and diverse workforce.


Supporting our employees through COVID-19 and beyond 


In response to COVID-19-related state and local government orders to stay at home, Alexandria immediately issued a $1,000 emergency bonus to each of our non-officer employees, connected employees to LiveHealth Online support, and shared comprehensive resources and tools to help our team members cope with stress, anxiety, isolation, and loss and also balance work and child care obligations. To further support our employees in prioritizing their health and well-being, the Company temporarily enhanced our existing wellness benefit. This enrichment included reimbursement of fitness and mindfulness applications, online classes, and exercise equipment to help our employees reach their individual wellness goals and stay physically and mentally strong. Additionally, Alexandria has been able to leverage our world-class network to curate a series of internal webinars featuring leading experts on COVID-19 to keep our employees informed and address some of their questions or pressing concerns.


Providing exceptional benefits to support our employees’ well-being, medical and financial health


We provide a comprehensive benefits package intended to meet and exceed the needs of our employees and their families. Our highly competitive offering helps our employees stay healthy, balance their work and personal lives, and meet their financial and retirement goals. We pay 100% of the health insurance premiums for our employees and their families and provide an employee assistance program to help them address a wide range of issues. In addition, Alexandria’s Operation CARE program provides the following services to our employees: 


•Alexandria Access. Alexandria’s unparalleled network in the life science community affords us access to deep medical expertise. Alexandria Access makes this expertise available to our employees and their immediate family members who are experiencing an illness or injury and would benefit from specialized expertise.


•Matching Gifts. Alexandria matches each employee’s financial contributions to, or funds raised for, eligible nonprofit organizations on a dollar-for-dollar basis, up to $2,500 per person each calendar year, to double the impact of their charitable gifts.

•Volunteer Rewards. When an Alexandria employee volunteers more than 25 hours in any one quarter at an eligible nonprofit(s), Alexandria donates a total of $2,500 to the eligible non-profit(s) of their choice.


Investing in professional development and training


We understand that to attract and retain the best talent, we must provide opportunities for our people to grow and develop. Therefore, we invest in training and development programs to enhance our employees’ engagement, effectiveness, and well-being.

flexibility, self-direction, and feedback. Our annual mentoring program allows employees to partner with senior leaders throughout the organization and receive career guidance. To customize training and development, we conduct needs assessments and design training programs for specific functional teams as well as offer a highly customized coaching program for high-potential executives, leaders, and teams. We provide access to expert panels and cutting-edge information via webinars in order to share information and support our team. We also provide on-demand learning resources such as LinkedIn Learning for employees to take classes that range from creating effective PowerPoint presentations to understanding how the brain reacts to stress.

Building a diverse and inclusive workforce


We work every day to create an open and respectful environment where everyone can actively contribute, have equal access to opportunities and resources, be themselves, and realize their potential.


Our Corporate Governance Guidelines highlight the Board of Directors’ focus on diversity, which explicitly states the board’s commitment to considering qualified women and minority director candidates, as well its policy of requesting an initial list of diverse candidates of any search firm it retains. As an Equal Opportunity Employer, we emphasize inclusion through hiring and compensation practices and consider a pool of diverse candidates for open positions and internal advancement opportunities. To address issues related to pay discrimination, we do not ask potential candidates about their current or previous compensation during the hiring process, and we incorporate equal and fair pay reviews into every employment compensation decision. To reinforce our corporate culture of respect, diversity, and inclusion, each of our employees completes anti-harassment training annually.
